### Dataset Summary

We propose to use the visual denotations of linguistic expressions (i.e. the set of images they describe) to define novel denotational similarity metrics, which we show to be at least as beneficial as distributional similarities for two tasks that require semantic inference. To compute these denotational similarities, we construct a denotation graph, i.e. a subsumption hierarchy over constituents and their denotations, based on a large corpus of 30K images and 150K descriptive captions.

Disclaimer: The team releasing Flickr30k did not upload the dataset to the Hub and did not write a dataset card. These steps were done by the Hugging Face team.

### Supported Tasks

- [Sentence Transformers](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers) training; useful for semantic search and sentence similarity. 

### Languages

- English.

## Dataset Structure

Each example in the dataset contains quintets of similar sentences and is formatted as a dictionary with the key "set" and a list with the sentences as "value":

```
{"set": [sentence_1, sentence_2, sentence3, sentence4, sentence5]}
{"set": [sentence_1, sentence_2, sentence3, sentence4, sentence5]}
...
{"set": [sentence_1, sentence_2, sentence3, sentence4, sentence5]}
```

This dataset is useful for training Sentence Transformers models. Refer to the following post on how to train models using similar pairs of sentences.

### Usage Example

Install the ðŸ¤— Datasets library with `pip install datasets` and load the dataset from the Hub with:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset("embedding-data/flickr30k-captions")
```
The dataset is loaded as a `DatasetDict` has the format:

```python
DatasetDict({
    train: Dataset({
        features: ['set'],
        num_rows: 31783
    })
})
```

Review an example `i` with:

```python
dataset["train"][i]["set"]
```
