**Context**

Generating humor is a complex task in the domain of machine learning, and it requires the models to understand the deep semantic meaning of a joke in order to generate new ones. Such problems, however, are difficult to solve due to a number of reasons, one of which is the lack of a database that gives an elaborate list of jokes. Thus, a large corpus of over 0.2 million jokes has been collected by scraping several websites containing funny and short jokes.

You can visit the [Github repository](https://github.com/amoudgl/short-jokes-dataset) from [amoudgl](https://github.com/amoudgl) for more information regarding collection of data and the scripts used.

**Content**

This dataset is in the form of a csv file containing 231,657 jokes. Length of jokes ranges from 10 to 200 characters. Each line in the file contains a unique ID and joke.

**Disclaimer**

It has been attempted to keep the jokes as clean as possible. Since the data has been collected by scraping websites, it is possible that there may be a few jokes that are inappropriate or offensive to some people.

**Note**

This dataset is taken from Kaggle dataset that can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhinavmoudgil95/short-jokes).
