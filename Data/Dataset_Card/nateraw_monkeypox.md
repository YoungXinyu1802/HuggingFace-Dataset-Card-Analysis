### Dataset Summary

## Context
- Monkeypox is an infectious disease caused by the monkeypox virus that can occur in certain animals, including humans. Symptoms begin with fever, headache, muscle pains, swollen lymph nodes, and feeling tired.
- An ongoing outbreak of monkeypox was confirmed on 6 May 2022, beginning with a British resident who, after traveling to Nigeria (where the disease is endemic), presented symptoms consistent with monkeypox on 29 April 2022. The resident returned to the United Kingdom on 4 May, creating the country's index case of the outbreak.
