### Curation Rationale

(The below is a partially corrected machine translation from [here](https://www.nb.no/sbfil/dok/nst_taledat_se.pdf) )

The data was developed by Nordisk spr√•kteknologi holding AS (NST),
which went bankrupt in 2003.

In 2006, a jointly owned group of the University of
Oslo, the University of Bergen, the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, the Language Council and IBM
bought the assets of NST, to ensure that the linguistic resources that NST had developed were
take care of. The National Library was commissioned by the Ministry of Culture to build a Norwegian
language bank in 2009, and started this work in 2010.

The resources after NST were transferred to the National Library in May 2011, and they are now done
available in the Language Bank, initially without further processing.
