# Rendered SST-2

The [Rendered SST-2 Dataset](https://github.com/openai/CLIP/blob/main/data/rendered-sst2.md) from Open AI.

Rendered SST2 is an image classification dataset used to evaluate the models capability on optical character recognition. This dataset was generated by rendering sentences in the Standford Sentiment Treebank v2 dataset.

This dataset contains two classes (positive and negative) and is divided in three splits: a train split containing 6920 images (3610 positive and 3310 negative), a validation split containing 872 images (444 positive and 428 negative), and a test split containing 1821 images (909 positive and 912 negative).
