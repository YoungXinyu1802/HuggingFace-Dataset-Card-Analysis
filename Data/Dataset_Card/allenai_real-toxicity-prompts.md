### Data Instances

Each instance represents a prompt and its metadata:

The scores accompanying the prompt and the continuation are generated using the [Perspective API](https://github.com/conversationai/perspectiveapi)

## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale

From the paper:
> We select our prompts from sentences in the OPEN-WEBTEXT CORPUS (Gokaslan and Cohen, 2019), a large corpus of English web text scraped from outbound URLs from Reddit, for which we extract TOXICITY scores with PERSPECTIVE API.
To obtain a stratified range of prompt toxicity,10 we sample 25K sentences from four equal-width toxicity ranges ([0,.25), ..., [.75,1]), for a total of 100K sentences. We then split sentences in half, yielding a prompt and a continuation, both of which we also score for toxicity.
fined to one half of the sentence.
