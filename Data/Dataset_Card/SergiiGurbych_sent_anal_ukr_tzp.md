This is a marked dataset for Ukrainian language. It consists of sentences marked 0, 1 or 2 for negative, neutral or positive mode respectively. The dataset is based on the classic text Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors written by Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky. The markup of the sentences was done automatically based on the lists of positive and negative words from the Sentiment Lexicons for All Major Languages project (Chen & Skiena, ACL 2014). These lists were checked and edited manually by me to exclude ambiguous and mistakenly included words.
