    "text": "announcement \nthe wrh server continues to be under intense attack by hillarys tantrum squad \nbut the site keeps bouncing back so if during the day you cannot connect wait a minute or two and try again thank you for your patience it is obvious the bad guys are in a state of total panic to act like this thought for the day we seek peace knowing that peace is the climate of freedom dwight d eisenhower your random dhs monitored phrase of the day dera \npaid advertising at what really happened may not represent the views and opinions of this website and its contributors no endorsement of products and services advertised is either expressed or implied \nhillary the spy  updated info \nlet us start with an historical fact treason and betrayal by the highest levels is a common feature of history whether it is judas vs jesus brutus vs julius caesar benedict arnold the rosenbergs jonathan pollard aldrich ames robert hanssen it is just a fact of life it does happen \nback in  when bill clinton was running for reelection he authorized the transfer of highly sensitive technology to china this technology had military applications and allowed china to close the gap in missile performance with the united states the transfers were opposed and severely criticized by the defense department \nat the same time bill clinton was transferring this technology to china huge donations began to pour into his reelection campaign from the us companies allowed to sell the technology to china and from american citizens of chinese descent the fact that they were us citizens allowed them to donate to political campaigns but it later emerged that they were acting as conduits for cash coming in from asian sources including chinese intelligence agencies the scandal eventually became known as chinagate \njohn huang \na close associate of indonesian industrialist james riady huang initially was appointed deputy secretary of commerce in  by  however he moved to the democratic national committee where he generated hundreds of thousands of dollars in illegal contributions from foreign sources huang later pleaded guilty to one felony count of campaign finance violations \ncharlie trie \nlike john huang trie raised hundreds of thousands of dollars in illegal contributions from foreign sources to democratic campaign entities he was a regular white house visitor and arranged meetings of foreign operators with clinton including one who was a chinese arms dealer his  contribution to clintons legal defense fund was returned after it was found to have been largely funded by asian interests trie was convicted of violating campaign finance laws in  \none of tries main sources of cash was chinese billionaire ng lap seng according to a senate report ng lap seng had connections to the chinese government seng was arrested in  over an unrelated bribery case but this gave investigators the opportunity to question seng about the chinagate scandal former united nations general assembly president john ashe was also caught in the bribery case and was about to testify to the links between the clintons and seng when he was found dead that very morning initially reported as having died from a heart attack johns throat had obviously been crushed at that point the official story changed to him accidentally dropping a barbell on his own throat \nng lap seng with the clintons \njohnny chung \ngave more than  to the democratic national committee prior to the  campaign but it was returned after officials learned it came from illegal foreign sources chung later told a special senate committee investigating  clinton campaign fundraising that  of his contributions came from individuals in chinese intelligence chung pleaded guilty to bank fraud tax evasion and campaign finance violations \nchinagate documented by judicial watch was uncovered by judicial watch founder larry klayman technology companies allegedly made donations of millions of dollars to various democratic party entities including president bill clintons  reelection campaign in return for permission to sell hightech secrets to china bernard schwartz and his loral space  communication ltd later allegedly helped china to identify the cause of a rocket failure thereby advancing chinas missile program and threatening us national security according to records \nthis establishes a history of the clintons treating us secrets as their own personal property and selling them to raise money for campaigns \nis history repeating itself it appears so \nlet us consider a private email server with weak security at least one known totally open access point no encryption at all and outside the control and monitoring systems of the us government on which are parked many of the nations most closely guarded secrets as well as those of the united nations and other foreign governments it is already established that hillarys email was hacked one hacker named guccifer provided copies of emails to russia today which published them",
