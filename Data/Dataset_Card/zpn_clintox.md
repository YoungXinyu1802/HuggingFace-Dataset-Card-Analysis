### Dataset Summary

`clintox` is a dataset included in [MoleculeNet](https://moleculenet.org/). Qualitative data of drugs approved by the FDA and those that have failed clinical trials for toxicity reasons. This uses the `CT_TOX` task.

Note, there was one molecule in the training set that could not be converted to SELFIES (`*C(=O)[C@H](CCCCNC(=O)OCCOC)NC(=O)OCCOC`)

## Dataset Structure

### Data Fields

Each split contains

* `smiles`: the [SMILES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_molecular-input_line-entry_system) representation of a molecule
* `selfies`: the [SELFIES](https://github.com/aspuru-guzik-group/selfies) representation of a molecule
* `target`: clinical trial toxicity (or absence of toxicity) 

### Data Splits

The dataset is split into an 80/10/10 train/valid/test split using scaffold split. 

### Source Data

#### Initial Data Collection and Normalization

Data was originially generated by the Pande Group at Standford

### Licensing Information

This dataset was originally released under an MIT license
