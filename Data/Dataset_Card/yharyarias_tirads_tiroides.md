Thyroid ultrasound images, classified into 5 classes that correspond to the European EU-TIRADS scale, this consists of:

EU-TIRADS 1: no nodule
EU-TIRADS 2: benign
EU-TIRADS 3: low risk (oval, smooth margin, iso / hyperechoic, no high risk features)
EU-TIRADS 4: intermediate risk (oval, smooth margin, mildly hypoechoic, no high risk features)
EU-TIRADS 5: any high risk features (non-oval, irregular margin, microcalcifications, marked hypoechogenicity)

Ultrasound images of the thyroid that were taken from the ultrasound scanners of the FOSCAL/FOSUNAB clinic, as a final master's project for the Polytechnic University of Valencia, in collaboration with doctors Federico Lubinus and Boris Marconi, who together with Yhary Arias have worked on the classification of said ultrasounds that are saved in .DICOM format and then transformed to PNG to make the process lighter. The strategy that was carried out for the collection of images and later their labeling was: for each examination that was carried out on patients with or without a possible diagnosis, only the images without personal or sensitive information were kept, all this on a hard drive. , then a pre-processing of the images was done, their format was changed and finally they were mounted on a web page with a single view to facilitate the classification of the doctors who were in charge of this arduous task. Ultrasounds were classified into 5 classes that correspond to the European EU-TIRADS scale, this consists of:

EU-TIRADS 1: no nodule
EU-TIRADS 2: benign
EU-TIRADS 3: low risk (oval, smooth margin, iso / hyperechoic, no high risk features)
EU-TIRADS 4: intermediate risk (oval, smooth margin, mildly hypoechoic, no high risk features)
EU-TIRADS 5: any high risk features (non-oval, irregular margin, microcalcifications, marked hypoechogenicity)

Risk of malignancy
EU-TIRADS 1: n/a
EU-TIRADS 2: 0%
EU-TIRADS 3: low risk (2-4%)
EU-TIRADS 4: intermediate risk (6-17%)
EU-TIRADS 5: high risk (26-87%)
