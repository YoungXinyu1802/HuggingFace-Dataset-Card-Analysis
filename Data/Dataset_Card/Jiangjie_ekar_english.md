### Dataset Summary

***New!***(9/18/2022) E-KAR `v1.1` is officially released (at the `main` branch), **with a higher-quality English dataset!** In `v1.1`, we further improve the Chinese-to-English translation quality of the English E-KAR, with over 600 problems and over 1,000 explanations manually adjusted. You can still find previous version (as in the paper) in the `v1.0` branch in the repo. For more information please refer to https://ekar-leaderboard.github.io.

The ability to recognize analogies is fundamental to human cognition. Existing benchmarks to test word analogy do not reveal the underneath process of analogical reasoning of neural models. Holding the belief that models capable of reasoning should be right for the right reasons, we propose a first-of-its-kind Explainable Knowledge-intensive Analogical Reasoning benchmark (E-KAR). Our benchmark consists of 1,655 (in Chinese) and 1,251 (in English) problems sourced from the Civil Service Exams, which require intensive background knowledge to solve. More importantly, we design a free-text explanation scheme to explain whether an analogy should be drawn, and manually annotate them for each and every question and candidate answer. Empirical results suggest that this benchmark is very challenging for some state-of-the-art models for both explanation generation and analogical question answering tasks, which invites further research in this area.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

- `analogical-qa`: The dataset can be used to train a model for analogical reasoning in the form of multiple-choice QA.
- `explanation-generation`: The dataset can be used to generate free-text explanations to rationalize analogical reasoning.

This dataset supports two task modes: EASY mode and HARD mode:
- `EASY mode`: where query explanation can be used as part of the input.
- `HARD mode`: no explanation is allowed as part of the input.

### Languages

This dataset is in English, which is translated from [its Chinese version](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Jiangjie/ekar_chinese/)

## Considerations for Using the Data

### Social Impact of Dataset

The purpose of this dataset is to help develop analogical reasoning systems that are right for the right reasons.

### Discussion of Biases

This dataset is sourced and translated from the Civil Service Examinations of China. Therefore, despite the effort that the authors try to remove or rewrite such problems, it may still contain information biased to Chinese culture.

### Other Known Limitations

1. The explanation annotation process in E-KAR (not the EG task) is mostly post-hoc and reflects only the result of reasoning. Humans solve the analogy problems in a trial-and-error manner, i.e., adjusting the abduced source structure and trying to find the most suited one for all candidate answers. Therefore, such explanations cannot offer supervision for intermediate reasoning.

2. E-KAR only presents one feasible explanation for each problem, whereas there may be several.

3. The English version of E-KAR is machine-translated and post-edited by humans. Although the authors have tried their best to maintain the translation quality, there could be some unsatisfying samples in the English dataset, e.g., culture-specific ones, ambiguous ones after translation, etc.
