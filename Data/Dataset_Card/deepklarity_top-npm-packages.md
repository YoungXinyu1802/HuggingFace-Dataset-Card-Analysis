**Top NPM Packages Dataset**

This dataset contains a snapshot of Top 3000 popular node packages hosted on [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/)

The dataset was scraped in `July-2022`. This includes a combination of data gathered by [Libraries.io](https://libraries.io/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

We aim to use this dataset to perform analysis and identify trends and get a bird's eye view of nodejs ecosystem.
