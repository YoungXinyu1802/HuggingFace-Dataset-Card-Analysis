# Dataset card for dynamically generated dataset hate speech detection

## Dataset summary

This dataset that was dynamically generated for training and improving hate speech detection models. A group of trained annotators generated and labeled challenging examples so that hate speech models could be tricked and consequently improved. This dataset contains about 40,000 examples of which 54% are labeled as hate speech. It also provides the target of hate speech, including vulnerable, marginalized, and discriminated groups. Overall, this is a balanced dataset which makes it different from the already available hate speech datasets you can find on the web.

This dataset was presented in the article [Learning from the Worst: Dynamically Generated Datasets to Improve Online Hate Detection published](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.132.pdf) in 2021. The article describes the process for generating and annotating the data. Also, it describes how they used the generated data for training and improving hate speech detection models.
