### Dataset Summary
This dataset contains pairs of equivalent sentences obtained from Wikipedia.

### Supported Tasks
- [Sentence Transformers](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers) training; useful for semantic search and sentence similarity. 
### Languages
- English.
## Dataset Structure
Each example in the dataset contains pairs of equivalent sentences and is formatted as a dictionary with the key "set" and a list with the sentences as "value".
```
{"set": [sentence_1, sentence_2]}
{"set": [sentence_1, sentence_2]}
...
{"set": [sentence_1, sentence_2]}
```
This dataset is useful for training Sentence Transformers models. Refer to the following post on how to train models using similar sentences.
### Usage Example
Install the ðŸ¤— Datasets library with `pip install datasets` and load the dataset from the Hub with:
```python
from datasets import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset("embedding-data/simple-wiki")
```
The dataset is loaded as a `DatasetDict` and has the format:
```python
DatasetDict({
    train: Dataset({
        features: ['set'],
        num_rows: 102225
    })
})
```
Review an example `i` with:
```python
dataset["train"][i]["set"]
```
