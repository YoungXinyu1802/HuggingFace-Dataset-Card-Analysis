### Dataset Summary

PartiPrompts (P2) is a rich set of over 1600 prompts in English that we release
as part of this work. P2 can be used to measure model capabilities across
various categories and challenge aspects.

P2 prompts can be simple, allowing us to gauge the progress from scaling. They
can also be complex, such as the following 67-word description we created for
Vincent van Goghâ€™s *The Starry Night* (1889):

*Oil-on-canvas painting of a blue night sky with roiling energy. A fuzzy and
bright yellow crescent moon shining at the top. Below the exploding yellow stars
and radiating swirls of blue, a distant village sits quietly on the right.
Connecting earth and sky is a flame-like cypress tree with curling and swaying
branches on the left. A church spire rises as a beacon over rolling blue hills.*
