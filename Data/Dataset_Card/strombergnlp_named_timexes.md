### Dataset Summary

This is a dataset annotated for _named temporal expression_ chunks.

The
commonest temporal expressions typically
contain date and time words, like April or
hours. Research into recognising and interpreting these typical expressions is mature in many languages. However, there is
a class of expressions that are less typical,
very varied, and difficult to automatically
interpret. These indicate dates and times,
but are harder to detect because they often do not contain time words and are not
used frequently enough to appear in conventional temporally-annotated corpora â€“
for example *Michaelmas* or *Vasant Panchami*.

For more details see [Recognising and Interpreting Named Temporal Expressions](https://aclanthology.org/R13-1015.pdf)

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

### Data Fields

Each tweet contains an ID, a list of tokens, and a list of timex chunk flags.


- `id`: a `string` feature.
- `tokens`: a `list` of `strings` .
- `ntimex_tags`: a `list` of class IDs (`int`s) for whether a token is out-of-timex or in a timex chunk.
