# Dataset Card for EstCOPA

### Dataset Summary

EstCOPA is an extended version of [XCOPA](https://huggingface.co/datasets/xcopa) that was created with a goal to further investigate Estonian language understanding of large language models. EstCOPA provides two new versions of train, eval and test datasets in Estonian: firstly, a machine translated (En->Et) version of original English COPA ([Roemmele et al., 2011](http://commonsensereasoning.org/2011/papers/Roemmele.pdf))  and secondly, a manually post-edited version of the same machine translated data.
