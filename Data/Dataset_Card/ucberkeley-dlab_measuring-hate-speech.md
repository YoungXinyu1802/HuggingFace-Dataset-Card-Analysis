## Dataset Description

- **Homepage:** http://hatespeech.berkeley.edu
- **Paper:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10277

# Dataset card for _Measuring Hate Speech_

This is a public release of the dataset described in Kennedy et al. (2020) and Sachdeva et al. (2022), consisting of 39,565 comments annotated by 7,912 annotators, for 135,556 combined rows. The primary outcome variable is the "hate speech score" but the 10 constituent ordinal labels (sentiment, (dis)respect, insult, humiliation, inferior status, violence, dehumanization, genocide, attack/defense, hate speech benchmark) can also be treated as outcomes.  Includes 8 target identity groups (race/ethnicity, religion, national origin/citizenship, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, political ideology) and 42 target identity subgroups, as well as 6 annotator demographics and 40 subgroups. The hate speech score incorporates an IRT adjustment by estimating variation in annotator interpretation of the labeling guidelines.

This dataset card is a work in progress and will be improved over time.

## Key dataset columns

 * hate_speech_score - continuous hate speech measure, where higher = more hateful and lower = less hateful. > 0.5 is approximately hate speech, < -1 is counter or supportive speech, and -1 to +0.5 is neutral or ambiguous.
 * text - lightly processed text of a social media post
 * comment\_id - unique ID for each comment
 * annotator\_id - unique ID for each annotator
 * sentiment - ordinal label that is combined into the continuous score
 * respect - ordinal label that is combined into the continuous score
 * insult - ordinal label that is combined into the continuous score
 * humiliate - ordinal label that is combined into the continuous score
 * status - ordinal label that is combined into the continuous score
 * dehumanize - ordinal label that is combined into the continuous score
 * violence - ordinal label that is combined into the continuous score
 * genocide - ordinal label that is combined into the continuous score
 * attack\_defend - ordinal label that is combined into the continuous score
 * hatespeech - ordinal label that is combined into the continuous score
 * annotator_severity - annotator's estimated survey interpretation bias

## Code to download

The dataset can be downloaded using the following python code:

```python
import datasets 
dataset = datasets.load_dataset('ucberkeley-dlab/measuring-hate-speech', 'binary')   
df = dataset['train'].to_pandas()
df.describe()
```
