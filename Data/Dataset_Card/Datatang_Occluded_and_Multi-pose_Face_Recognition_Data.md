### Dataset Summary

1,930 People with Occlusion and Multi-pose Face Recognition Data, for each subject, 200 images were collected. The 200 images includes 4 kinds of light conditions * 10 kinds of occlusion cases (including non-occluded case) * 5 kinds of face pose. This data can be applied to computer vision tasks such as occluded face detection and recognition.
