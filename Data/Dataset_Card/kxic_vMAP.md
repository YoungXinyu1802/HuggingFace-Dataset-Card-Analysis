Replica Dataset for vMAP, including 8 sequences, and for each sequence, we rendered two different trajectories 00 and 01. 
Traj 00 is same as iMAP, while traj 01 is a different traj for 2D novel view synthesis rendering evaluation. 
The habitat folder in each sequence contains 3D models of each composed object for 3D geometrical evaluation.
