**Top Flutter Packages Dataset**
Flutter is an open source framework by Google for building beautiful, natively compiled, multi-platform applications from a single codebase. It is gaining quite a bit of popularity because of ability to code in a single language and have it running on Android/iOS and web as well.

This dataset contains a snapshot of Top 5000+ flutter/dart packages hosted on [Flutter package repository](https://pub.dev/)

The dataset was scraped in `July-2022`. 

We aim to use this dataset to perform analysis and identify trends and get a bird's eye view of the rapidly evolving flutter ecosystem.
