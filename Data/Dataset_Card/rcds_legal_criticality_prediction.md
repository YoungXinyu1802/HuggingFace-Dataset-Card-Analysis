### Dataset Summary

Legal Criticality Prediction (LCP) is a multilingual, diachronic dataset of 130K Swiss Federal Supreme Court (FSCS) cases annotated with two criticality labels. The bge_label i a binary label (critical, non-critical), while the citation label has 5 classes (critical-1, critical-2, critical-3, critical-4, non-critical). Critical classes of the citation_label are distinct subsets of the critical class of the bge_label. This dataset creates a challenging text classification task. We also provide additional metadata as the publication year, the law area and the canton of origin per case, to promote robustness and fairness studies on the critical area of legal NLP.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

LCP can be used as text classification task

### Languages

Switzerland has four official languages with three languages German, French and Italian being represenated. The decisions are written by the judges and clerks in the language of the proceedings.
German (80k), French (40k), Italian (10k)

## Dataset Creation
### Curation Rationale

The dataset was curated by Stern et al. (2023).

### Source Data
#### Initial Data Collection and Normalization

The original data are published from the Swiss Federal Supreme Court (https://www.bger.ch) in unprocessed formats (HTML). The documents were downloaded from the Entscheidsuche portal (https://entscheidsuche.ch) in HTML. 

#### Who are the source language producers?

The decisions are written by the judges and clerks in the language of the proceedings.

### Annotations
#### Annotation process

bge_label:
1. all bger_references in the bge header were extracted
2. bger file_names are compared with the found references

citation_label:
1. count all citations for all bger cases and weight citations
2. divide cited cases in four different classes, depending on amount of citations

#### Who are the annotators?

Ronja Stern annotated the citations.
Metadata is published by the Swiss Federal Supreme Court (https://www.bger.ch).

### Personal and Sensitive Information

The dataset contains publicly available court decisions from the Swiss Federal Supreme Court. Personal or sensitive information has been anonymized by the court before publication according to the following guidelines: https://www.bger.ch/home/juridiction/anonymisierungsregeln.html.
