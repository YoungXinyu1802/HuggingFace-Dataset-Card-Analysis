# MNLI Norwegian
The Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MultiNLI) corpus is a crowd-sourced collection of 433k sentence pairs annotated with textual entailment information. The corpus is modeled on the SNLI corpus, but differs in that it covers a range of genres of spoken and written text, and supports a distinctive cross-genre generalisation evaluation. There is also a [HuggingFace version](https://huggingface.co/datasets/multi_nli) of the dataset available. 

This dataset is machine translated using Google Translate. From this translation different version of the dataset where created. Included in the repo is a version that is specifically suited for training sentence-BERT-models. This version include the triplet: base-entailment-contradiction. It also includes a version that mixes English and Norwegian, as well as both csv and json-verions. The script for generating the datasets are included in this repo. 

Please note that there is no test dataset for MNLI, since this is closed. The authors of MNLI informs us that they selected 7500 new contexts in the same way as the original MNLI contexts. That means the English part of the XNLI test sets is highly comparable. For each genre, the text is generally in-domain with the original MNLI test set (it's from the same source and selected by me in the same way). In most cases the XNLI test set can therefore be used. 

### The following datasets are available in the repo:

* mnli_no_en_for_simcse.csv
* mnli_no_en_small_for_simcse.csv
* mnli_no_for_simcse.csv
* multinli_1.0_dev_matched_no_mt.jsonl
* multinli_1.0_dev_mismatched_no_mt.jsonl
* multinli_1.0_train_no_mt.jsonl
* nli_for_simcse.csv
* xnli_dev_no_mt.jsonl
* xnli_test_no_mt.jsonl
