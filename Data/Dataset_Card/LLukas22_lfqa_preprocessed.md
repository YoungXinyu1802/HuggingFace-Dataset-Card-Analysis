## Dataset Description

- **Homepage:** [https://towardsdatascience.com/long-form-qa-beyond-eli5-an-updated-dataset-and-approach-319cb841aabb](https://towardsdatascience.com/long-form-qa-beyond-eli5-an-updated-dataset-and-approach-319cb841aabb)


### Dataset Summary

This is a simplified version of [vblagoje's](https://huggingface.co/vblagoje) *[lfqa_support_docs](https://huggingface.co/datasets/vblagoje/lfqa_support_docs)* and *[lfqa](https://huggingface.co/datasets/vblagoje/lfqa)* datasets.
It was generated by me to have a more straight forward way to train Seq2Seq models on context based long form question answering tasks.

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

An example of 'train' looks as follows.

```json
{
    "question": "what's the difference between a forest and a wood?",
    "answer": "They're used interchangeably a lot. You'll get different answers from different resources, but the ...",
    "context": [
        "Wood is divided, according to its botanical origin, into two kinds: softwoods, ...",
        "Processing and products differs especially with regard to the distinction between softwood and hardwood ..."
    ]
}
```

### Data Fields

The data fields are the same among all splits.

- `question`: a `string` feature.
- `answer`: a `string` feature.
- `context`: a list feature containing `string` features.
