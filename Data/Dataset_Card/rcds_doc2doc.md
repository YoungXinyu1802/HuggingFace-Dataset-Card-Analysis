### Dataset Summary

doc2doc is a multilingual, diachronic dataset of 130K Swiss Federal Supreme Court (FSCS) cases annotated with law citations and ruling citations, posing a challenging text classification task. As unique label we are using decision_id of cited rulings and uuid of cited law articles, which can be found in the SwissCourtRulingCorpus. We also provide additional metadata, i.e., the publication year, the legal area and the canton of origin per case, to promote robustness and fairness studies on the critical area of legal NLP.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

doc2doc can be used as information retrieval task.

### Languages

Switzerland has four official languages with three languages (German 85K, French 30k and Italian 10k) being represented. The decisions are written by the judges and clerks in the language of the proceedings.
