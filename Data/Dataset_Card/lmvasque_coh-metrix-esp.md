## About this dataset

The dataset Coh-Metrix-Esp (Cuentos) [(Quispesaravia et al., 2016)](https://aclanthology.org/L16-1745/) is a collection of 100 documents consisting of 50 children fables (“simple” texts) and 50 stories for adults (“complex” texts) scrapped from the web. If you use this data, please credit the original website and our work as well (see citations below).
