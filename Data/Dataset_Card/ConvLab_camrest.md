# Dataset Card for Camrest

- **Repository:** https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/260970
- **Paper:** https://aclanthology.org/D16-1233/
- **Leaderboard:** None
- **Who transforms the dataset:** Qi Zhu(zhuq96 at gmail dot com)

To use this dataset, you need to install [ConvLab-3](https://github.com/ConvLab/ConvLab-3) platform first. Then you can load the dataset via:
```
from convlab.util import load_dataset, load_ontology, load_database

dataset = load_dataset('camrest')
ontology = load_ontology('camrest')
database = load_database('camrest')
```

### Dataset Summary

Cambridge restaurant dialogue domain dataset collected for developing neural network based dialogue systems. The two papers published based on this dataset are: 1. A Network-based End-to-End Trainable Task-oriented Dialogue System 2. Conditional Generation and Snapshot Learning in Neural Dialogue Systems. The dataset was collected based on the Wizard of Oz experiment on Amazon MTurk. Each dialogue contains a goal label and several exchanges between a customer and the system. Each user turn was labelled by a set of slot-value pairs representing a coarse representation of dialogue state (`slu` field). There are in total 676 dialogue, in which most of the dialogues are finished but some of dialogues were not.

- **How to get the transformed data from original data:** 
  - Run `python preprocess.py` in the current directory. Need `../../camrest/` as the original data.
- **Main changes of the transformation:**
  - Add dialogue act annotation according to the state change. This step was done by ConvLab-2 and we use the processed dialog acts here.
  - Rename `pricerange` to `price range`
  - Add character level span annotation for non-categorical slots.
- **Annotations:**
  - user goal, dialogue acts, state.
