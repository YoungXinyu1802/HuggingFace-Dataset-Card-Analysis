# Dpin Style Embedding / Textual Inversion

<img alt="Showcase" src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/Nerfgun3/dpin_style/resolve/main/dpin_showcase.png"/>

## Usage

To use this embedding you have to download the file aswell as drop it into the "\stable-diffusion-webui\embeddings" folder

To use it in a prompt: ```"dpin_style"```

Personally, I would recommend to use my embeddings with a strength of 0.8, like ```"(dpin_style:0.8)"```

I hope you enjoy the embedding. If you have any questions, you can ask me anything via Discord: "Nerfgun3#7508"
