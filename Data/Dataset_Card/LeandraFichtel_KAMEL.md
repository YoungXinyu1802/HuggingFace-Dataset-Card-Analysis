### Dataset Summary
This dataset provides the data for KAMEL, a probing dataset for language models that contains factual knowledge
from Wikidata and Wikipedia.

See the paper for more details.  For more information, also see:

## Dataset Structure
### Data Instances


### Data Fields
KAMEL has the following fields:
* index: the id
* sub_label: a label for the subject 
* obj_uri: Wikidata uri for the object 
* obj_labels:  multiple labels for the object
* chosen_label: the preferred label  
* rel_uri: Wikidata uri for the relation
* rel_label: a label for the relation

### Data Splits
The dataset is split into a training, validation, and test dataset.
It contains 234 Wikidata relations. 
For each relation there exist 200 training, 100 validation,
and 100 test instances.

## Dataset Creation
### Curation Rationale
This dataset was gathered and created to explore what knowledge graph facts are memorized by large language models.
### Source Data
#### Initial Data Collection and Normalization
See the reaserch paper and website for more detail. The dataset was
created from Wikidata and Wikipedia.
### Annotations
#### Annotation process
There is no human annotation, but only automatic linking from Wikidata facts to Wikipedia articles.
The details about the process can be found in the paper.
#### Who are the annotators?
Machine Annotations
### Personal and Sensitive Information
Unkown, but likely information about famous people mentioned in the English Wikipedia.
## Considerations for Using the Data
### Social Impact of Dataset
The goal for the work is to probe the understanding of language models.
### Discussion of Biases
Since the data is created from Wikipedia and Wikidata, the existing biases from these two data sources may also be reflected in KAMEL.
## Additional Information
### Dataset Curators
The authors of KAMEL at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and Technische Universit√§t Braunschweig.
