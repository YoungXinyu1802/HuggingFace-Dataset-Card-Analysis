### Dataset Summary
Dataset with pairs of equivalent sentences.
The dataset is provided "AS IS" without any warranty, express or implied. 
Google disclaims all liability for any damages, direct or indirect, resulting from using the dataset.

Disclaimer: The team releasing sentence-compression did not upload the dataset to the Hub and did not write a dataset card. These steps were done by the Hugging Face team.

### Supported Tasks
- [Sentence Transformers](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers) training; useful for semantic search and sentence similarity. 
### Languages
- English.
## Dataset Structure
Each example in the dataset contains pairs of equivalent sentences and is formatted as a dictionary with the key "set" and a list with the sentences as "value".
```
{"set": [sentence_1, sentence_2]}
{"set": [sentence_1, sentence_2]}
...
{"set": [sentence_1, sentence_2]}
```
This dataset is useful for training Sentence Transformers models. Refer to the following post on how to train models using similar pairs of sentences.
### Usage Example
Install the ðŸ¤— Datasets library with `pip install datasets` and load the dataset from the Hub with:
```python
from datasets import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset("embedding-data/sentence-compression")
```
The dataset is loaded as a `DatasetDict` and has the format:
```python
DatasetDict({
    train: Dataset({
        features: ['set'],
        num_rows: 180000
    })
})
```
Review an example `i` with:
```python
dataset["train"][i]["set"]
```
