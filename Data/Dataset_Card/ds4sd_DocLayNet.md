### Dataset Summary

DocLayNet provides page-by-page layout segmentation ground-truth using bounding-boxes for 11 distinct class labels on 80863 unique pages from 6 document categories. It provides several unique features compared to related work such as PubLayNet or DocBank:

1. *Human Annotation*: DocLayNet is hand-annotated by well-trained experts, providing a gold-standard in layout segmentation through human recognition and interpretation of each page layout
2. *Large layout variability*: DocLayNet includes diverse and complex layouts from a large variety of public sources in Finance, Science, Patents, Tenders, Law texts and Manuals
3. *Detailed label set*: DocLayNet defines 11 class labels to distinguish layout features in high detail.
4. *Redundant annotations*: A fraction of the pages in DocLayNet are double- or triple-annotated, allowing to estimate annotation uncertainty and an upper-bound of achievable prediction accuracy with ML models
5. *Pre-defined train- test- and validation-sets*: DocLayNet provides fixed sets for each to ensure proportional representation of the class-labels and avoid leakage of unique layout styles across the sets.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

We are hosting a competition in ICDAR 2023 based on the DocLayNet dataset. For more information see https://ds4sd.github.io/icdar23-doclaynet/.

## Dataset Structure

### Data Fields

DocLayNet provides four types of data assets:

1. PNG images of all pages, resized to square `1025 x 1025px`
2. Bounding-box annotations in COCO format for each PNG image
3. Extra: Single-page PDF files matching each PNG image
4. Extra: JSON file matching each PDF page, which provides the digital text cells with coordinates and content

The COCO image record are defined like this example

```js
    ...
    {
      "id": 1,
      "width": 1025,
      "height": 1025,
      "file_name": "132a855ee8b23533d8ae69af0049c038171a06ddfcac892c3c6d7e6b4091c642.png",

      // Custom fields:
      "doc_category": "financial_reports" // high-level document category
      "collection": "ann_reports_00_04_fancy", // sub-collection name
      "doc_name": "NASDAQ_FFIN_2002.pdf", // original document filename
      "page_no": 9, // page number in original document
      "precedence": 0, // Annotation order, non-zero in case of redundant double- or triple-annotation
    },
    ...
```

The `doc_category` field uses one of the following constants:

```
financial_reports,
scientific_articles,
laws_and_regulations,
government_tenders,
manuals,
patents
```


### Data Splits

The dataset provides three splits
- `train`
- `val`
- `test`

## Dataset Creation

### Annotations

#### Annotation process

The labeling guideline used for training of the annotation experts are available at [DocLayNet_Labeling_Guide_Public.pdf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DS4SD/DocLayNet/main/assets/DocLayNet_Labeling_Guide_Public.pdf).


#### Who are the annotators?

Annotations are crowdsourced.
