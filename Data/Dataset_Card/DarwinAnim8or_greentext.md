# Greentext Dataset

This is content pulled from various archives to create a "greentext bot" or sorts using GPT-JT. 
Really, just a dumb joke I made with some friends. 

## Biases & Limitations
This dataset contains charaters such as \n and u2019d that need to be filtered out manually.
Needless to say, this dataset contains *many* instances of profanity & biases, as it is trained on data from hell. 
I don't recommend actually using any of this.
