### Dataset Summary

The MAGPIE corpus ([Haagsma et al. 2020](https://aclanthology.org/2020.lrec-1.35/)) is a large sense-annotated corpus of potentially idiomatic expressions (PIEs), based on the British National Corpus (BNC). Potentially idiomatic expressions are like idiomatic expressions, but the term also covers literal uses of idiomatic expressions, such as 'I leave work at the end of the day.' for the idiom 'at the end of the day'. This version of the dataset reflects the filtered subset used by [Dankers et al. (2022)](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.252/) in their investigation on how PIEs are represented by NMT models. Authors use 37k samples annotated as fully figurative or literal, for 1482 idioms that contain nouns, numerals or adjectives that are colors (which they refer to as keywords). Because idioms show syntactic and morphological variability, the focus is mostly put on nouns. PIEs and their context are separated using the original corpusâ€™s word-level annotations.

### Languages

The language data in MAGPIE is in English (BCP-47 `en`)

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

The `magpie` configuration contains sentences with annotations for the presence, usage an type of potentially idiomatic expressions. An example from the `train` split of the `magpie` config (default) is provided below.

```json
{
    'sentence': 'There seems to be a dearth of good small tools across the board.',
    'annotation': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
    'idiom': 'across the board',
    'usage': 'figurative',
    'variant': 'identical',
    'pos_tags': ['ADV', 'VERB', 'PART', 'VERB', 'DET', 'NOUN', 'ADP', 'ADJ', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'ADP', 'DET', 'NOUN']
}
```

The text is provided as-is, without further preprocessing or tokenization.

The fields are the following:

- `sentence`: The sentence containing a PIE.
- `annotation`: List of 0s and 1s of the same length of the whitespace-tokenized sentence, with 1s corresponding to the position of the idiomatic expression.
- `idiom`: The idiom contained in the sentence in its base form.
- `usage`: Either `figurative` or `literal`, depending on the usage of the PIE.
- `variant`: `identical` if the PIE matches the base form of the idiom, otherwise specifies the variation.
- `pos_tags`: List of POS tags associated with words in the sentence.
