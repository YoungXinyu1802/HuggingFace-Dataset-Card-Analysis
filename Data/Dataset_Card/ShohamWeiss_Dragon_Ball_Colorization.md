Side-by-side images of Dragon Ball scenes. On the left: A grayscale outline of the scene. On the right: A colored version of the same scene.
The data was taken from downloaded Dragon Ball episodes and preprocessed using OpenCV to remove color and take the outlines of the drawings. Then the pre-processed and post-processed images were concatenated side by side.
