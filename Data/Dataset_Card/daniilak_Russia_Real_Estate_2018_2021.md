### Content
The Russian real estate market has a relatively short history. In the Soviet era, all properties were state-owned; people only had the right to use them with apartments allocated based on one's place of work. As a result, options for moving were fairly limited. However, after the fall of the Soviet Union, the Russian real estate market emerged and Muscovites could privatize and subsequently sell and buy properties for the first time. Today, Russian real estate is booming. It offers many exciting opportunities and high returns for lifestyle and investment.
