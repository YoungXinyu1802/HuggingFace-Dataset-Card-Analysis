# Amazon Counterfactual Statements

This dataset is the *en-ext* split from [SetFit/amazon_counterfactual](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SetFit/amazon_counterfactual). As the original test set is rather small (1333 examples), a different split was created with 50-50 for training & testing.

The dataset is described in [amazon-multilingual-counterfactual-dataset](https://github.com/amazon-research/amazon-multilingual-counterfactual-dataset) / [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.06893.pdf)

It contains statements from Amazon reviews about events that did not or cannot take place.
