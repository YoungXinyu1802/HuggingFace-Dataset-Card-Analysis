# About Dataset

### Context

Text summarization is a way to condense the large amount of information into a concise form by the process of selection of important information and discarding unimportant and redundant information. With the amount of textual information present in the world wide web the area of text summarization is becoming very important. The extractive summarization is the one where the exact sentences present in the document are used as summaries. The extractive summarization is simpler and is the general practice among the automatic text summarization researchers at the present time. Extractive summarization process involves giving scores to sentences using some method and then using the sentences that achieve highest scores as summaries. As the exact sentence present in the document is used the semantic factor can be ignored which results in generation of less calculation intensive summarization procedure. This kind of summary is generally completely unsupervised and language independent too. Although this kind of summary does its job in conveying the essential information it may not be necessarily smooth or fluent. Sometimes there can be almost no connection between adjacent sentences in the summary resulting in the text lacking in readability.
