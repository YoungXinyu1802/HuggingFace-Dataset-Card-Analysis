# Birds of Australia

As described on RAWPIXEL:

Considered the “Father of bird study in Australia”, John Gould (1804–1881) is one of the most celebrated publications on ornithology worldwide. His book "Birds of Australia" (1840–1848) illustrated by his wife, Elizabeth Gould (1804–1841) introduced more than 300 new birds to the world. His work also contributed to the much revered Charles Darwin’s book ‘On the Origins of Species’. Available under the Creative Commons 0 license.
