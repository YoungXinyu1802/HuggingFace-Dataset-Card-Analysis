This is a list of camera shots from screenplays (scripts) for a series of animated cartoons,
plus data from the animated scenes created manually for the series.
Over time, I will add more details to the scenes. The goal is to be able to create as much
as the scenes as possible from just writing a screenplay to reduce the manual effort to
ultimately create an episode. It does not have to achieve everything, just reduce the effort.
E.g. a first step is to work out which characters are in a shot from the script.
This may need looking at previous shots however as they may be in the background still.
Next, can the location of the characters be worked out from text alone (the data does not
have their position and rotation yet). Then lighting, props, animation clips, and more - see
how much can be deduced from the script alone.
