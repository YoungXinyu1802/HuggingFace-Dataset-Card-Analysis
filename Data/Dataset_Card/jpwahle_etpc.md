### Dataset Summary
We present the Extended Paraphrase Typology (EPT) and the Extended Typology Paraphrase Corpus (ETPC). The EPT typology addresses several practical limitations of existing paraphrase typologies: it is the first typology that copes with the non-paraphrase pairs in the paraphrase identification corpora and distinguishes between contextual and habitual paraphrase types. ETPC is the largest corpus to date annotated with atomic paraphrase types. It is the first corpus with detailed annotation of both the paraphrase and the non-paraphrase pairs and the first corpus annotated with paraphrase and negation. Both new resources contribute to better understanding the paraphrase phenomenon, and allow for studying the relationship between paraphrasing and negation. To the developers of Paraphrase Identification systems ETPC corpus offers better means for evaluation and error analysis. Furthermore, the EPT typology and ETPC corpus emphasize the relationship with other areas of NLP such as Semantic Similarity, Textual Entailment, Summarization and Simplification.
### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

## Dataset Structure
### Data Fields
- `idx`: Monotonically increasing index ID.
- `sentence1`: Complete sentence expressing an opinion about a film.
- `sentence2`: Complete sentence expressing an opinion about a film.
- `etpc_label`: Whether the text-pair is a paraphrase, either "yes" (1) or "no" (0) according to etpc annotation schema.
- `mrpc_label`: Whether the text-pair is a paraphrase, either "yes" (1) or "no" (0) according to mrpc annotation schema.
- `negation`: Whether on sentence is a negation of another, either "yes" (1) or "no" (0).
