## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale

The original intention is to use the dataset to "translate" between modern and 17th-century English. By doing so, we can potentially read understand things from that period more clearly.

## Considerations for Using the Data

### Social Impact of Dataset

### Discussion of Biases

### Other Known Limitations

Before the 18th and 19th centuries, English spelling was inconsistent. Because of this, the model often does not recognize spellings different from those in the KJV.
The model was trained on a relatively small amount of data, so it will not be as accurate as a model trained on a larger data set.
