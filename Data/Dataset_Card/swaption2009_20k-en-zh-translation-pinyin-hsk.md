2. HSK level
3. Chinese translation
4. Pinyin
5. separator ("\-\-")

# Other Info from the Source

### HSK level
All of the sentences came from sample sentences intended to describe a
particular word. HSK level (in the category name) signifies the HSK
level of the word this sentence describes. Note that "HSK level" is
1-4.

### Limitation

This is a search of all characters in each level, including the
characters that loner words are composed of. This is why even HSK
level 4 sentences can contain sentences in "limited 1."

For example, 作主 (zuo4zhu3) is an HSK level 4 word. It contains 2
characters which both appear in other HSK level 1 words, and so the
sample sentence for 作主 (assuming that sentence contains no other
difficult words) might appear in the category "HSK 4; limited 1;"
