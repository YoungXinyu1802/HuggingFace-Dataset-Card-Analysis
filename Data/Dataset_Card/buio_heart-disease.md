The [Heart Disease Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease) is provided by the Cleveland Clinic Foundation for Heart Disease. It's a CSV file with 303 rows. Each row contains information about a patient (a sample), and each column describes an attribute of the patient (a feature). We use the features to predict whether a patient has a heart disease (binary classification).

It is originally [hosted here]("http://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/data/heart.csv").
