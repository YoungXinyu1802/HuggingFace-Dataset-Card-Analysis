# langame-seeker

Self chat between two [Seeker Search-Augmented Language Model](https://parl.ai/projects/seeker/) using [Langame](https://langa.me/) conversation starters generated by Langame's proprietary language model. The 3000 conversation starters have been generated beforehand into an "offline" dataset and manually corrected and adjusted by psychologically and philosophically trained humans.

The search engine source code is unfortunately private yet, some work need to be done to make it open source.
