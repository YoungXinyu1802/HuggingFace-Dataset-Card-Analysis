To use this dataset, you need to install [ConvLab-3](https://github.com/ConvLab/ConvLab-3) platform first. Then you can load the dataset via:
```
from convlab.util import load_dataset, load_ontology, load_database

dataset = load_dataset('crosswoz')
ontology = load_ontology('crosswoz')
database = load_database('crosswoz')
```

### Dataset Summary

CrossWOZ is the first large-scale Chinese Cross-Domain Wizard-of-Oz task-oriented dataset. It contains 6K dialogue sessions and 102K utterances for 5 domains, including hotel, restaurant, attraction, metro, and taxi. Moreover, the corpus contains rich annotation of dialogue states and dialogue acts at both user and system sides. We also provide a user simulator and several benchmark models for pipelined taskoriented dialogue systems, which will facilitate researchers to compare and evaluate their models on this corpus.

- **How to get the transformed data from original data:** 
  - Run `python preprocess.py` in the current directory. Need `../../crosswoz/` as the original data.
- **Main changes of the transformation:**
  - Add simple description for domains, slots, and intents.
  - Switch intent&domain of `General` dialog acts => domain == 'General' and intent in ['thank','bye','greet','welcome']
  - Binary dialog acts include: 1) domain == 'General'; 2) intent in ['NoOffer', 'Request', 'Select']; 3) slot in ['酒店设施']
  - Categorical dialog acts include: slot in ['酒店类型', '车型', '车牌']
  - Non-categorical dialogue acts: others. assert intent in ['Inform', 'Recommend'] and slot != 'none' and value != 'none'
  - Transform original user goal to list of `{domain: {'inform': {slot: [value, mentioned/not mentioned]}, 'request': {slot: [value, mentioned/not mentioned]}}}`, stored as `user_state` of user turns.
  - Transform `sys_state_init` (first API call of system turns) without `selectedResults` as belief state in user turns.
  - Transform `sys_state` (last API call of system turns) to `db_query` with domain states that contain non-empty `selectedResults`. The `selectedResults` are saved as `db_results` (only contain entity name). Both stored in system turns.
- **Annotations:**
  - user goal, user state, dialogue acts, state, db query, db results.
  - Multiple values in state are separated by spaces, meaning all constraints should be satisfied.
