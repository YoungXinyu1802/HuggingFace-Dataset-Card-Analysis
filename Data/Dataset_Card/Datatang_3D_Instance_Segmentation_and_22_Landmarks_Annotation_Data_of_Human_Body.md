### Dataset Summary

18,880 Images of 466 People - 3D Instance Segmentation and 22 Landmarks Annotation Data of Human Body. The dataset diversity includes multiple scenes, light conditions, ages, shooting angles, and poses. In terms of annotation, we adpoted instance segmentation annotations on human body. 22 landmarks were also annotated for each human body. The dataset can be used for tasks such as human body instance segmentation and human behavior recognition.
