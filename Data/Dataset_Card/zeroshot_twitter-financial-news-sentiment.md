Read this [BLOG](https://neuralmagic.com/blog/classifying-finance-tweets-in-real-time-with-sparse-transformers/) to see how I fine-tuned a sparse transformer on this dataset.

### Dataset Description

The Twitter Financial News dataset is an English-language dataset containing an annotated corpus of finance-related tweets. This dataset is used to classify finance-related tweets for their sentiment.

1. The dataset holds 11,932 documents annotated with 3 labels:

```python
sentiments = {
    "LABEL_0": "Bearish", 
    "LABEL_1": "Bullish", 
    "LABEL_2": "Neutral"
}  
```

The data was collected using the Twitter API. The current dataset supports the multi-class classification task.

### Task: Sentiment Analysis
