<b>DISCLAIMER:</b> This dataset was published [here](https://github.com/RussianNLP/RuCoLA) by the RussianNLP team and is the result of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.12814.pdf). I take no credit nor responsibility in the content and one should contact/cite the authors directly if needed.

The Russian Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability (RuCoLA) is a dataset consisting of Russian language sentences with their binary acceptability judgements. It includes expert-written sentences from linguistic publications and machine-generated examples.

The corpus covers a variety of language phenomena, ranging from syntax and semantics to generative model hallucinations. We release RuCoLA to facilitate the development of methods for identifying errors in natural language and create a public leaderboard to track the progress on this problem.
