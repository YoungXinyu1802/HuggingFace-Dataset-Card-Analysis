This data is from the github repo https://github.com/Jiaxin-Pei/Certainty-in-Science-Communication about the paper "Measuring Sentence-Level and Aspect-Level (Un)certainty in Science Communications" by Jiaxin Pei and David Jurgens.
I put it here for later use, to train an ML model which estimates claim certainty.
