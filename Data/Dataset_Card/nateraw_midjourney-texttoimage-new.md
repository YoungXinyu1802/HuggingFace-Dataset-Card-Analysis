### Dataset Summary

General Context
===
[Midjourney](https://midjourney.com) is an independent research lab whose broad mission is to "explore new mediums of thought". In 2022, they launched a text-to-image service that, given a natural language prompt, produces visual depictions that are faithful to the description. Their service is accessible via a public [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/midjourney), where users interact with a [Midjourney bot](https://midjourney.gitbook.io/docs/#create-your-first-image). When issued a query in natural language, the bot returns four low-resolution images and offers further options like upscaling or re-generating a variation of the original images.

This dataset was obtained by scraping messages from the public Discord server over a period of four weeks (June 20, 2002 - July 17, 2022). The authors have no affiliation with Midjourney and are releasing this data with the sole purpose of enabling research on text-to-image model prompting (see the Sample Use Case section below).

Midjourney's Discord Server
---
Here is what the interaction with the Midjourney bot looks like on Discord:
1. Issuing an initial prompt:

2. Upscaling the bottom-left image:

3. Requesting variations of the bottom-left image:

Dataset Format
===
The dataset was produced by scraping ten public Discord channels in the "general" category (i.e., with no dedicated topic) over four weeks. Filenames follow the pattern `channel-name_yyyy_mm_dd.json`. The `"messages"` field in each JSON file contains a list of [Message](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/channel#message-object) objects, one per user query. A message includes information such as the user-issued prompt, a link to the generated image, and other metadata. See [the companion notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/succinctlyai/midjourney-prompt-analysis) with utilities for extracting such information.

Dataset Stats
===
The dataset contains:
- **268k** messages from 10 public Discord channel collected over 28 days.
- **248k** user-generated prompts and their associated generated images, out of which:
	+ 60% are requests for new images (initial or variation requests for a previously-generated image), and
	+ 40% are requests for upscaling previously-generated images.
	
Prompt Analysis
===
Here are the most prominent phrases among the user-generated text prompts:
![word cloud](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1J432wrecf2zibDFU5sT3BXFxqmt3PJ-P)

Prompt lengths span from 1 to 60 whitespace-separated tokens, with the mode around 15 tokens:

See the [the companion notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/succinctlyai/midjourney-prompt-analysis) for an in-depth analysis of how users control various aspects of the generated images (lighting, resolution, photographic elements, artistic style, etc.).

Sample Use Case
===
One way of leveraging this dataset is to help address the [prompt engineering](https://www.wired.com/story/dalle-art-curation-artificial-intelligence/) problem: artists that use text-to-image models in their work spend a significant amount of time carefully crafting their text prompts. We built an additional model for prompt autocompletion by learning from the queries issued by Midjourney users. [This notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/succinctlyai/midjourney-text-prompts-huggingface) shows how to extract the natural language prompts from the Discord messages and create a HuggingFace dataset to be used for training. The processed dataset can be found at [succinctly/midjourney-prompts](https://huggingface.co/datasets/succinctly/midjourney-prompts), and the prompt generator (a GPT-2 model fine-tuned on prompts) is located at [succinctly/text2image-prompt-generator](https://huggingface.co/succinctly/text2image-prompt-generator).

Here is how our model can help brainstorm creative prompts and speed up prompt engineering:
