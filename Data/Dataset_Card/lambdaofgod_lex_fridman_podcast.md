# lex_fridman_podcast

## Data

This dataset provides transcribed Lex Fridman Podcast episodes that were shared on [Andrej Karpathy's site](https://karpathy.ai/lexicap).

Last update was on 01.12.2022.

## Goal 

The goal of this dataset is to use it in [niph - needle in podcast haystack](https://github.com/lambdaofgod/niph) library to make searching it easier.

There exist other similar datasets, but they lack timestamp information that makes finding stuff on Karpathy's page easier.

### Schema
```
 #   Column          Non-Null Count   Dtype 
---  ------          --------------   ----- 
 0   episode         802299 non-null  object
 1   text            802299 non-null  object
 2   timestamp_link  802299 non-null  object
```

## Acknowledgements

LONG LIVE ANDREJ KARPATHY!
