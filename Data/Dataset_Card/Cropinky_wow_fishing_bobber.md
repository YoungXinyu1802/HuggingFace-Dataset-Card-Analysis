## Wow fishing bobber object detection dataset
Hello, in this zip you will find 160 annotated images each containing 1 fishing bobber from World of warcraft.
I think this is an easy object detection datset, my yolov3 network was trained on it for 2000 iterations, it achieved
a loss of 0.05. It was working flawlessly as it classified the newly generated images (also from wailing caverns zone)
I haven't even tested it how it would work outside or on other fishing locations in the game, pozz.
