### This is the v3 of my Sideview embedding,
here you can download all steps saved.
Personlly I recommend going in 1000 steps up from 2000, depending on if you want more style or less.
*REMEMBER:*
to use the embedding it will need to be in you Auto1111 embeddings folder and you will need to use the name in your prompt, see civitai page for more info.
some example prompts to use:
a man with a mohawk and a yellow scarf on his head and a yellow background with a black and yellow design, art by flonixsdviewv3
a man with a mask on his face and a city in the background with blue lines and a orange background with a circle, art by flonixsdviewv3
a man with dreadlocks and a gas mask on his face, with a red and black background, art by flonixsdviewv3
