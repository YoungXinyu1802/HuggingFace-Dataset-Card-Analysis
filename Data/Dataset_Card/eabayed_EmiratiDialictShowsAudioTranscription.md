This dataset contains two files: a zipped file with segmented audio files from Emirati TV shows, podcasts, or YouTube channels, and a tsv file containing the transcription of the zipped audio files.
The purpose of the dataset is to act as a benchmark for Automatic Speech Recognition models that work with the Emirati dialect. 
The dataset is made so that it covers different categories: traditions, cars, health, games, sports, and police.
Although the dataset is for the emirati dialect, sometimes people talking in a different dialect could be found in the shows, and they are kept as is.
