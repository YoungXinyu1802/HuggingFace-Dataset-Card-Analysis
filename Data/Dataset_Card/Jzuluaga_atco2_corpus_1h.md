- **Repository:** [ATCO2 corpus](https://github.com/idiap/atco2-corpus)

### Dataset Summary

ATCO2 project aims at developing a unique platform allowing to collect, organize and pre-process air-traffic control (voice communication) data from air space. This project has received funding from the Clean Sky 2 Joint Undertaking (JU) under grant agreement No 864702. The JU receives support from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme and the Clean Sky 2 JU members other than the Union.

The project collected the real-time voice communication between air-traffic controllers and pilots available either directly through publicly accessible radio frequency channels or indirectly from air-navigation service providers (ANSPs). In addition to the voice communication data, contextual information is available in a form of metadata (i.e. surveillance data). The dataset consists of two distinct packages:

- A corpus of 5000+ hours (pseudo-transcribed) of air-traffic control speech collected across different airports (Sion, Bern, Zurich, etc.) in .wav format for speech recognition. Speaker distribution is 90/10% between males and females and the group contains native and non-native speakers of English.
- A corpus of 4 hours (transcribed) of air-traffic control speech collected across different airports (Sion, Bern, Zurich, etc.) in .wav format for speech recognition. Speaker distribution is 90/10% between males and females and the group contains native and non-native speakers of English. This corpus has been transcribed with orthographic information in XML format with speaker noise information, SNR values and others. Read Less
- A free sample of the 4 hours transcribed data is in [ATCO2 project homepage](https://www.atco2.org/data)

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

- `automatic-speech-recognition`. Already adapted/fine-tuned models are available here --> [Wav2Vec 2.0 LARGE mdel](https://huggingface.co/Jzuluaga/wav2vec2-large-960h-lv60-self-en-atc-uwb-atcc-and-atcosim).

### Languages and other details

The text and the recordings are in English. For more information see Table 3 and Table 4 of [ATCO2 corpus paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04054)

## Dataset Structure

### Data Fields

- `id (string)`: a string of recording identifier for each example, corresponding to its.
- `audio (audio)`: audio data for the given ID
- `text (string)`: transcript of the file already normalized. Follow these repositories for more details [w2v2-air-traffic](https://github.com/idiap/w2v2-air-traffic) and [bert-text-diarization-atc](https://github.com/idiap/bert-text-diarization-atc)
- `segment_start_time (float32)`: segment start time (normally 0)
- `segment_end_time (float32): segment end time
- `duration (float32)`: duration of the recording, compute as segment_end_time - segment_start_time

## Additional Information

### Licensing Information

The licensing status of the ATCO2-test-set-1h corpus is in the file **ATCO2-ASRdataset-v1_beta - End-User Data Agreement** in the data folder. Download the data in [ATCO2 project homepage](https://www.atco2.org/data)
