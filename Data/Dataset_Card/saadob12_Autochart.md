# Description from the original gitlab repo

Analytical description of charts is an exciting and important research area with many academia and industry benefits. Yet, this challenging task has received limited attention from the computational linguistics research community. This paper aims to encourage more research into this important area by proposing AutoChart, the first large chart analytical description dataset. Specifically, we offer a novel framework that generates the charts and their analytical description automatically. We also empirically demonstrate that the generate analytical descriptions are diverse, coherent, and relevant to the corresponding charts.
