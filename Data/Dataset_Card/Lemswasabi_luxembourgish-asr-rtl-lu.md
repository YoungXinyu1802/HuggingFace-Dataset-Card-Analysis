# About the Speech Corpus

`luxembourgish-asr-rtl-lu` dataset is a speech corpus for the under-resourced Luxembourgish language. The audio-transcription pairs were collected from [RTL.lu](http://www.rtl.lu/).
We used forced alignment to segment the audio files. The transcriptions were validated with the help of language experts at the [Center for the Luxembourgish Language](https://portal.education.lu/zls).
