### Dataset Summary

500 Hours â€“ Minnan Dialect Conversational Speech Data by Mobile Phone.The dataset is recorded by about 1,000 local Hokkien speakers. The recording people are from Quanzhou, Zhangzhou and Xiamen. The ratio of male and female is balanced, covering multiple age groups. There is no preset corpus for the voice data. In order to ensure the smooth and natural dialogue, the recorder will start the dialogue and record it according to the topic he is familiar with.
