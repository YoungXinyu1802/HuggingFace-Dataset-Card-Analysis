### Dataset Summary

This dataset contains:
> 1614 paintings belonging to the categories Baroque, Rococo, and Other. The images were obtained using the Europeana Search API, selecting open objects from the art thematic collection. 24k images were obtained, from which the current dataset was derived. The labels were added by the V4Design team, using a custom annotation tool. As described in the project documentation, other categories were used besides Baroque and Rococo. But for the sake of training a machine learning model we have retained only the categories with a significant number of annotations [source](https://zenodo.org/record/4896487)

This version of the dataset is generated using the [CSV file](https://zenodo.org/record/4896487) hosted on Zenodo. This CSV file contains the labels with URLs for the relevant images. Some of these URLs no longer resolve to an image. For consitency with the original dataset and if these URLs become valid again, these rows of the data are preserved here. If you want only successfully loaded images in your dataset, you can filter out the missing images as follows. 

```python
ds = ds.filter(lambda x: x['image'] is not None)
```
