Regarding image classification automation, Maderapp's botanical team worked many hours to collect, validate, and correctly label 25000 tree macroscopic images of 25 species from the Peruvian Amazonia. 

The team captured these images with a mobile device's camera and a digital microscope. Each image has a resolution of 480X640 pixels and three channels.
