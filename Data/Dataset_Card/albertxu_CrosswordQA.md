### Dataset Summary

The CrosswordQA dataset is a set of over 6 million clue-answer pairs scraped from the New York Times and many other crossword publishers. The dataset was created to train the Berkeley Crossword Solver's QA model. See our paper for more information. Answers are automatically segmented (e.g., BUZZLIGHTYEAR -> Buzz Lightyear), and thus may occasionally be segmented incorrectly.
