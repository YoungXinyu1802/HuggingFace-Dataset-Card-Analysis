# Dataset Card for `beir/hotpotqa/train`

The `beir/hotpotqa/train` dataset, provided by the [ir-datasets](https://ir-datasets.com/) package.
For more information about the dataset, see the [documentation](https://ir-datasets.com/beir#beir/hotpotqa/train).

# Data

This dataset provides:
 - `queries` (i.e., topics); count=85,000
 - `qrels`: (relevance assessments); count=170,000

 - For `docs`, use [`irds/beir_hotpotqa`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/irds/beir_hotpotqa)

## Usage

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

queries = load_dataset('irds/beir_hotpotqa_train', 'queries')
for record in queries:
    record # {'query_id': ..., 'text': ...}

qrels = load_dataset('irds/beir_hotpotqa_train', 'qrels')
for record in qrels:
    record # {'query_id': ..., 'doc_id': ..., 'relevance': ..., 'iteration': ...}

```

Note that calling `load_dataset` will download the dataset (or provide access instructions when it's not public) and make a copy of the
data in ðŸ¤— Dataset format.
