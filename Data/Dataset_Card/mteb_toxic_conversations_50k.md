# Toxic Conversation
This is a version of the [Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification/overview). It contains comments from the  Civil Comments platform together with annotations if the comment is toxic or not.

This dataset just contains the first 50k training examples.

10 annotators annotated each example and, as recommended in the task page, set a comment as toxic when target >= 0.5

The dataset is inbalanced, with only about 8% of the comments marked as toxic.
