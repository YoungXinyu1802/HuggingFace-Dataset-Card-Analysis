# Description
The dataset represents huge number of images of people wearing face masks or not to be used extensively for train/test splitting. Selected files were double-checked to avoid data collection bias using common sense.

# Sources
The dataset obtained and combined from various open data sources, including following:

- https://www.kaggle.com/frabbisw/facial-age
- https://www.kaggle.com/nipunarora8/age-gender-and-ethnicity-face-data-csv
- https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/faces-age-detection-dataset
- https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection
- manually obtained under-represented observations using Google search engine

# Structure

The dataset is curated and structured into three age groups (under 18, 18-65 and 65+) without initial test/train selection, which is achieved programmatically to allow manipulations with original data.
