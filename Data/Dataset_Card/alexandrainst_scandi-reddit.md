- **Point of Contact:** [Dan Saattrup Nielsen](mailto:dan.nielsen@alexandra.dk)

### Dataset Summary

ScandiReddit is a filtered and post-processed corpus consisting of comments from [Reddit](https://reddit.com/).

All Reddit comments from December 2005 up until October 2022 were downloaded through [PushShift](https://files.pushshift.io/reddit/comments/), after which these were filtered based on the FastText language detection model. Any comment which was classified as Danish (`da`), Norwegian (`no`), Swedish (`sv`) or Icelandic (`is`) with a confidence score above 70% was kept.

The resulting comments were then deduplicated, removing roughly 438,000 comments. 5,000 comments written by Reddit bots were removed, and roughly 189,000 comments belonging to inappropriate subreddits (explicit and drug-related) were also removed.

Lastly, we remove roughly 40,000 near-duplicate comments from the resulting corpus, where near-duplicate here means that the comments have more than 80% of their word 5-grams in common.


### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards
