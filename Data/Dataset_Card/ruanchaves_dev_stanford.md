# Dataset Card for Dev-Stanford

## Dataset Description

- **Repository:** [ardax/hashtag-segmentor](https://github.com/ardax/hashtag-segmentor)
- **Paper:** [Segmenting Hashtags and Analyzing Their Grammatical Structure](https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/asi.23989?author_access_token=qbKcE1jrre5nbv_Tn9csbU4keas67K9QMdWULTWMo8NOtY2aA39ck2w5Sm4ePQ1MZhbjCdEuaRlPEw2Kd12jzvwhwoWP0fdroZAwWsmXHPXxryDk_oBCup1i9_VDNIpU)

### Dataset Summary

1000 hashtags manually segmented by Ã‡elebi et al. for development purposes, 
randomly selected from the Stanford Sentiment Tweet Corpus by Sentiment140.

### Languages

English

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

```
{
    "index": 15,
    "hashtag": "marathonmonday",
    "segmentation": "marathon monday"
}
```

### Data Fields

- `index`: a numerical index.
- `hashtag`: the original hashtag.
- `segmentation`: the gold segmentation for the hashtag.

## Dataset Creation

- All hashtag segmentation and identifier splitting datasets on this profile have the same basic fields: `hashtag` and `segmentation` or `identifier` and `segmentation`.

- The only difference between `hashtag` and `segmentation` or between `identifier` and `segmentation` are the whitespace characters. Spell checking, expanding abbreviations or correcting characters to uppercase go into other fields.

- There is always whitespace between an alphanumeric character and a sequence of any special characters ( such as `_` , `:`, `~` ). 

- If there are any annotations for named entity recognition and other token classification tasks, they are given in a `spans` field.
