### Dataset Summary

RGB Arabic Alphabet Sign Language (AASL) dataset comprises 7,857 raw and fully labelled RGB images of the Arabic sign language alphabets, which to our best knowledge is the first publicly available RGB dataset. The dataset is aimed to help those interested in developing real-life Arabic sign language classification models. AASL was collected from more than 200 participants and with different settings such as lighting, background, image orientation, image size, and image resolution. Experts in the field supervised, validated and filtered the collected images to ensure a high-quality dataset.
