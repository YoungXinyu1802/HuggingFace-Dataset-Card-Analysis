There has been limited research aiming to automate the document-to-slides generation process and all face a critical challenge: no publicly available dataset for training and benchmarking. In this work, we first contribute a new dataset, SciDuet, consisting of pairs of papers and their corresponding slides decks from recent years{'} NLP and ML conferences (e.g., ACL). Secondly, we present D2S, a novel system that tackles the document-to-slides task with a two-step approach: 1) Use slide titles to retrieve relevant and engaging text, figures, and tables; 2) Summarize the retrieved context into bullet points with long-form question answering. Our evaluation suggests that long-form QA outperforms state-of-the-art summarization baselines on both automated ROUGE metrics and qualitative human evaluation.",

### Dataset Structure

#### How were labels chosen?

<!-- info: How were the labels chosen? -->
<!-- scope: microscope -->
The original papers and slides (both are in PDF format) are carefully processed by a combination of PDF/Image processing tookits. The text contents from multiple slides that correspond to the same slide title are mreged.

#### Data Splits

<!-- info: Describe and name the splits in the dataset if there are more than one. -->
<!-- scope: periscope -->
Training, validation and testing data contain 136, 55, and 81 papers from ACL Anthology and their corresponding slides, respectively. 

#### Splitting Criteria

<!-- info: Describe any criteria for splitting the data, if used. If there are differences between the splits (e.g., if the training annotations are machine-generated and the dev and test ones are created by humans, or if different numbers of annotators contributed to each example), describe them here. -->
<!-- scope: microscope -->
The dataset integrated into GEM is the ACL portion of the whole dataset described in the [paper](https://aclanthology.org/2021.naacl-main.111), It contains the full Dev and Test sets, and a portion of the Train dataset. 
Note that although we cannot release the  whole training dataset due to copyright issues, researchers can still use our released data procurement code to generate the training dataset from the online ICML/NeurIPS anthologies.
