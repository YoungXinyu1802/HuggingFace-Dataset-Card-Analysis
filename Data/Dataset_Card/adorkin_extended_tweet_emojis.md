### Dataset Summary

This dataset is comprised of `emoji` and `emotion` subsets of [tweet_eval](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tweet_eval). The motivation
is that the original `emoji` subset essentially contains only positive/neutral emojis, while `emotion` subset contains a varied array
of emotions. So, the idea was to replace emotion labels with corresponding emojis (sad, angry) in the `emotion` subset and mix it together
with the `emoji` subset.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

Similar to tweet eval the expected usage is text classification.

### Languages

Only English is present in the dataset.
