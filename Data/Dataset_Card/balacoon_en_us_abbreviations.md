# en-US abbrevations

This is a dataset of abbreviations.
Contains examples of abbreviations and regular words.
There are two subsets:

- <mark>wiki</mark> - more accurate, manually annotated subset. Collected
  from abbreviations in wiki and words in CMUdict.
- <mark>kestrel</mark> - tokens that are automatically annotated by Google
  text normalization into **PLAIN** and **LETTERS** semiotic
  classes. Less accurate, but bigger. Files additionally contain frequency
  of token (how often it appeared) in a second column for possible filtering.
