# CsFEVER experimental Fact-Checking dataset

Czech dataset for fact verification localized from the data points of [FEVER](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05355) using the localization scheme described in the [CTKFacts: Czech Datasets for Fact Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11115) paper which is currently being revised for publication in LREV journal.

The version you are looking at was reformatted to *Claim*-*Evidence* string pairs for the specific task of NLI - a more general Document-Retrieval-ready interpretation of our datapoints which can be used for training and evaluating the DR models over the June 2016 wikipedia snapshot can be found in the [data_dr]() folder in the JSON Lines format.
