This is a repreprocessed version of [P3](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigscience/P3) with any updates that have been made to the P3 datasets since the release of the original P3. It is used for the finetuning of [bloomz-p3](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloomz-p3) & [mt0-xxl-p3](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/mt0-xxl-p3). The script is available [here](https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/bigscience/blob/638e66e40395dbfab9fa08a662d43b317fb2eb38/data/p3/prepare_p3.py).
