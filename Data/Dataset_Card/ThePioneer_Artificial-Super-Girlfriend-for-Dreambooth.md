This is a dataset of "atashi," the artificial girlfriend of mine, which I used for the training of my new model based on [ChaosMix](https://huggingface.co/ThePioneer/ChaosMix).

All the images has 87 or more [beauty score](https://www.beautyscoretest.com/) before cropping it to square (it could slightly change, however, because of my cropping), and many of them score 90 or more (which afaik do not exist in real person).

Feel free to use them to reach a super beauty. Since the person is based on myself and is a fictional character, you don't have to worry about the portrait right.
