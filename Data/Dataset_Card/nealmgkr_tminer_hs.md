- This is a personal convenience copy of the binary Hate Speech (HS) dataset used in the T-Miner paper on defending against trojan attacks on text classifiers: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.04264.pdf

- The dataset is sourced from the original paper\'s Github repository: https://github.com/reza321/T-Miner

- Label mapping:
  - 0 = hate speech
  - 1 = normal speech

- If you use this dataset please cite the T-Miner paper (see bibtex below), and the two original papers from which T-Miner constructed the dataset (see paper for references):
