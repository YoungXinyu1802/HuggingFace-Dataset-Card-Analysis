### Dataset Summary

GitHub Issues is a dataset consisting of GitHub issues and pull requests associated with the ðŸ¤— Datasets [repository](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets). It is intended for educational purposes and can be used for semantic search or multilabel text classification. The contents of each GitHub issue are in English and concern the domain of datasets for NLP, computer vision, and beyond.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

For each of the tasks tagged for this dataset, give a brief description of the tag, metrics, and suggested models (with a link to their HuggingFace implementation if available). Give a similar description of tasks that were not covered by the structured tag set (repace the `task-category-tag` with an appropriate `other:other-task-name`).

- `task-category-tag`: The dataset can be used to train a model for [TASK NAME], which consists in [TASK DESCRIPTION]. Success on this task is typically measured by achieving a *high/low* [metric name](https://huggingface.co/metrics/metric_name). The ([model name](https://huggingface.co/model_name) or [model class](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/model_class.html)) model currently achieves the following score. *[IF A LEADERBOARD IS AVAILABLE]:* This task has an active leaderboard which can be found at [leaderboard url]() and ranks models based on [metric name](https://huggingface.co/metrics/metric_name) while also reporting [other metric name](https://huggingface.co/metrics/other_metric_name).

### Languages

Provide a brief overview of the languages represented in the dataset. Describe relevant details about specifics of the language such as whether it is social media text, African American English,...

When relevant, please provide [BCP-47 codes](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47), which consist of a [primary language subtag](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47#section-2.2.1), with a [script subtag](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47#section-2.2.3) and/or [region subtag](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47#section-2.2.4) if available.
