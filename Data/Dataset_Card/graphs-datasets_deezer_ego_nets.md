## Dataset Description
- **[Homepage](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/deezer_ego_nets.html)**
- **Paper:**:  (see citation)


### Dataset Summary
The Deezer ego nets dataset contains ego-nets of Eastern European users collected from the music streaming service Deezer in February 2020. Nodes are users and edges are mutual follower relationships. 

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards
The related task is the binary classification to predict gender for the ego node in the graph.

## External Use
### PyGeometric
To load in PyGeometric, do the following:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

from torch_geometric.data import Data
from torch_geometric.loader import DataLoader

dataset_hf = load_dataset("graphs-datasets/<mydataset>")
# For the train set (replace by valid or test as needed)
dataset_pg_list = [Data(graph) for graph in dataset_hf["train"]]
dataset_pg = DataLoader(dataset_pg_list)
```

## Dataset Structure
### Data Fields

Each row of a given file is a graph, with: 
- `edge_index` (list: 2 x #edges): pairs of nodes constituting edges
- `y` (list:  #labels): contains the number of labels available to predict
- `num_nodes` (int): number of nodes of the graph

### Data Splits

This data is not split, and should be used with cross validation. It comes from the PyGeometric version of the dataset.

## Additional Information

### Licensing Information
The dataset has been released under GPL-3.0 license.
