## Dataset Description

**Homepage: https://ntrs.nasa.gov/**

### Dataset Summary
The NTRS collects scientific and technical information funded or created by NASA and provides metadata but also access to abstracts and full texts.
The dataset contains all abstracts, titles, and associated metadata indexed on the NTRS.
The most recent bulk download can be aquired via the NTRS directly at:
https://sti.nasa.gov/harvesting-data-from-ntrs/

This repository does not claim any ownership on the provided data, it only is supposed to provide an easily accesible gateway to the data, through the Huggingface API. 
The original author and source should always be credited.

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

The dataset contain over 508000 objects (abstracts) and associated metadata from NASA funded projects in time range of 1917 to today (18.06.2022). 
It therefore is a rich data source for language modeling in the domain of spacecraft design and space science.

## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale

The last bulk download was done on 18.06.2022. The dataset was cleaned from abstracts that occur multiple times. 

## Considerations for Using the Data

Main field that probably interest people:

"abstract", "subjectCategory", "keywords", "center"
