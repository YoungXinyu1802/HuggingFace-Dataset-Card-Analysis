# LoRA - niji_jelly

![niji_jelly_showcase_2.png](https://s3.amazonaws.com/moonup/production/uploads/1675184146576-6366fabccbf2cf32918c2830.png)

LoRA trained on images trained on from MidJourney's Niji style, specifically the jelly look.

All image examples are on the dalcefoV3Anime model: https://civitai.com/models/5398/dalcefov3animepastelmix

I recommend using the LoRA at around 0.8 emphasis for best results.
