### Dataset Summary

A Spanish Natural Language Inference dataset put together from the sources:
 - the Spanish slice of the XNLI dataset;
 - machine-translated Spanish version of the SNLI dataset
 - machine-translated Spanish version of the Multinli dataset

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

[Needs More Information]

### Languages

A small percentage of the dataset contains original Spanish text by human speakers. The rest was generated by automatic translation.

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

A line includes four values: a sentence1 (the premise); a sentence2 (the hypothesis); a label specifying the relationship between the two ("gold_label") and the ID number of the pair of sentences as given in the original dataset.

Labels can be "entailment" if the premise entails the hypothesis, "contradiction" if it contradicts it or "neutral" if it neither implies it nor denies it.

{  
 "gold_label": "neutral",  
 "pairID": 1,  
 "sentence1": "A ver si nos tenemos que poner todos en huelga hasta cobrar lo que queramos.",  
 "sentence2": "La huelga es el método de lucha más eficaz para conseguir mejoras en el salario."  
}

### Data Fields

gold_label: A string defining the relation between the sentence pair. Labels can be "entailment" if the premise entails the hypothesis, "contradiction" if it contradicts it or "neutral" if it neither implies it nor denies it.

pairID: A string identifying a pair sentence. It was inherited from the original datasets. NOTE: For the moment we are having trouble loading this column so we replaced every string with an int 0 as a placeholder. We hope to have the pairID back up soon.

sentence1: A string containing one sentence in Spanish, the premise. (See gold_label.)

sentence2: A string containing one sentence in Spanish, the hypothesis. (See gold_label.)

### Data Splits

The whole dataset was used for training. We did not use an evaluation split as we used the SemEval-2015 Task 2.

## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale

This corpus was built to remedy the scarcity of annotated Spanish-language datasets for NLI. It was generated by translating from the SNLI original dataset to Spanish using Argos. While machine translation is far from an ideal source for semantic classification, it is an aid to enlarging the data available.

### Source Data

#### Initial Data Collection and Normalization

### Personal and Sensitive Information

In general, no sensitive information is conveyed in the sentences.

## Considerations for Using the Data

### Social Impact of Dataset

The purpose of this dataset is to offer new tools for semantic textual similarity analysis of Spanish sentences.

### Discussion of Biases

Please refer to the respective documentations of the original datasets:  
https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/  
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.05053.pdf  
https://cims.nyu.edu/~sbowman/multinli/

### Other Known Limitations

The translation of the sentences was mostly unsupervised and may introduce some noise in the corpus. Machine translation from an English-language corpus is likely to generate syntactic and lexical forms that differ from those a human Spanish speaker would produce.
