# Darkest-Diffusion-v1.0 Dataset

[Alternative download link of this dataset](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qkd93vqfxjt9zkd/14%20%27Darkest%20Dungeon%27%20trainiing%20images.7z?dl=0)

##### This is the dataset I used to train version 1.0 of my [Darkest-Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/ai-characters/4elements-diffusion) model. That model was trained on the artstyle of the "Darkest Dungeon" game for Stable Diffusion v1.5. The dataset is composed of 14 manually captioned images.

The images were captioned using [BatchPrompter](https://github.com/Snowad14/BatchPrompter). For more information on how I trained the model, visit the model page.

**I appreciate any donations to my KoFi to help me fund renting GPU's for further model creation and experimentation!** I experiment a lot to achieve the highest possible model quality and flexbility, but this much experimentation requires me to train a lot of different models which in turn costs me a lot in GPU renting costs. So any amount of donations would help me greatly to offset some of the costs!
