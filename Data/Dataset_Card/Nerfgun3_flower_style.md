# Flower Style Embedding / Textual Inversion

<img alt="Showcase" src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/Nerfgun3/flower_style/resolve/main/flower_style_showcase.jpg"/>

## Usage
To use this embedding you have to download the file aswell as drop it into the "\stable-diffusion-webui\embeddings" folder

To use it in a prompt: ```"art by flower_style"```

If it is to strong just add [] around it.

Trained until 15000 steps

I added a 7.5k steps trained ver in the files aswell. If you want to use that version, remove the ```"-7500"``` from the file name and replace the 15k steps ver in your folder

Have fun :)
