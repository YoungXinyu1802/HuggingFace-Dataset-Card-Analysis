# Funniest responses dataset
This crowdsourced dataset is a dataset of the funniest answers we've collected over time. The collection started in feb. 8 of 2023.

## Usage

Here's how the data looks.
```
;о
Hello, how are you doing?
Better than you
;а
I have 100 trillion parameters in my brain, that's a lot more than you have)))
But half of them are trained to be an idiot.
;
...
```
It starts with 2 text lines - an input and an output, then there's a line with ";" in it which says that it's a new sample.
Each dataset is the language in 3 letters with .txt, like rus.txt
";" no info about the next lines
";о" means aggressive response
";а" means contains aggressive words
";м" means that any of next lines contain swearing.
WARNING, THOSE ARE RUSSIAN LETTERS.
