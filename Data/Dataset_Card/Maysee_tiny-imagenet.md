# Dataset Card for tiny-imagenet

## Dataset Description

- **Homepage:** https://www.kaggle.com/c/tiny-imagenet
- **Repository:** [Needs More Information]
- **Paper:** http://cs231n.stanford.edu/reports/2017/pdfs/930.pdf
- **Leaderboard:** https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-tiny-imagenet-1

### Dataset Summary

Tiny ImageNet contains 100000 images of 200 classes (500 for each class) downsized to 64Ã—64 colored images. Each class has 500 training images, 50 validation images, and 50 test images.

### Languages

The class labels in the dataset are in English.

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

```json
{
  'image': <PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x1A800E8E190,
  'label': 15
}
```

### Data Fields

- image: A PIL.Image.Image object containing the image. Note that when accessing the image column: dataset[0]["image"] the image file is automatically decoded. Decoding of a large number of image files might take a significant amount of time. Thus it is important to first query the sample index before the "image" column, i.e. dataset[0]["image"] should always be preferred over dataset["image"][0].
- label: an int classification label. -1 for test set as the labels are missing. Check `classes.py` for the map of numbers & labels.

### Data Splits

|              | Train  | Valid |
| ------------ | ------ | ----- |
| # of samples | 100000 | 10000 |

## Usage

### Example

#### Load Dataset
```python
def example_usage():
    tiny_imagenet = load_dataset('Maysee/tiny-imagenet', split='train')
    print(tiny_imagenet[0])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    example_usage()
```
