# Cute Style Embedding / Textual Inversion

## Usage
To use this embedding you have to download the file aswell as drop it into the "\stable-diffusion-webui\embeddings" folder

This Style doesnt really has a specific theme, it just turns the expression of girls into "cute"

To use it in a prompt: ```"drawn by cute_style"```

If it is to strong just add [] around it.

Trained until 6000 steps

Have fun :)
