# Artic Dataset

This dataset was created using artic API, and the descriptions were scraped from the artic.edu website. The scraping code is shared at [github.com/abhisharsinha/gsoc](https://github.com/abhisharsinha/gsoc/)

The images are hosted at this [google cloud bucket](https://storage.googleapis.com/mys-released-models/gsoc/artic-dataset.zip) The image filenames correspond to `image_id` in the tabular dataset.

The description was only available for selected artworks. `full_description` is the whole text scraped from the description page. `description` is the first paragraph of the `full_description`.
