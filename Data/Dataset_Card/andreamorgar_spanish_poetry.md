# Spanish Poetry Dataset
There are not many poetry datasets, and in Spanish language is even worst! With this dataset, we want to give access to these quality Spanish data for NLP tasks.
It is a simple dataset, but its potential is huge. I'm itching to discover new literary structures within Spanish literature data, a wider analysis, and so on!

### Motivation
This dataset was built for the PyConES2020 conference with the purpose of using it for a poem generation task. More information: https://github.com/andreamorgar/poesIA 

### Content
Data was acquired in July 2020 from the poetry webpage www.poemas-del-alma.com. It provides a wide amount of data involving poems in Spanish. Data was scraped using Python library BeautifulSoup. For each poem in www.poemas-del-alma.com, we collected the name of the poet, poem, and poem title. Scraping processed is available at https://github.com/andreamorgar/poesIA/blob/master/poetry-scrapper.py.

### Languages
Spanish

### Acknowledgements
We wouldn't be here without www.poemas-del-alma.com, which provides the poetry collection in this dataset.
