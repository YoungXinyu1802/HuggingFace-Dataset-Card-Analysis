# QANom 

This dataset contains question-answer pairs to model the predicate-argument structure of deverbal nominalizations. 
The questions start with wh-words (Who, What, Where, What, etc.) and contain the verbal form of a nominalization from the sentence; 
the answers are phrases in the sentence. 

See the paper for details: [QANom: Question-Answer driven SRL for Nominalizations (Klein et. al., COLING 2020)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.coling-main.274/)

The dataset was annotated by selected workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk.
