# Dataset stats

Total dataset size are 136039 and splitted into train-test-validation via 7-2-1 ratio. The split are same as [alexa-qa-with-rank](https://huggingface.co/datasets/theblackcat102/alexa-qa-with-rank), so no train question in alexa-qa can be found in validation and test splits in alex-qa-with-rank.
