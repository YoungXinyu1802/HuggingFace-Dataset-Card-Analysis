# Aggregated Cannabis Laboratory Test Results

Lab results are arguably among the most valuable data that you can come by in the cannabis industry. Due to the complexity of the data and, until now, a lack of standardization, the lab results that are publicly available have been just out of reach. Cannlytics puts these lab results in your hands, fresh, clean, and standardized, ripe for you to calculate juicy cannabis statistics.
