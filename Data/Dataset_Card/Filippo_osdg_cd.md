## Dataset Description

- **Homepage:** [OSDG-CD homepage](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6393942)

### Dataset Summary

The OSDG Community Dataset (OSDG-CD) is a public dataset of thousands of text excerpts, which were validated by approximately 1,000 OSDG Community Platform (OSDG-CP) citizen scientists from over 110 countries, with respect to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

> **_NOTE:_**  There are currently no examples for SDGs 16 and 17. See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/osdg-ai/osdg-data/issues/3).

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

TBD

### Languages

The language of the dataset is English.

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

For each instance, there is a string for the text, a string for the SDG, and an integer for the label.

```
{'text': 'Each section states the economic principle, reviews international good practice and discusses the situation in Brazil.',
 'label': 5}
```

The average token count for the premises and hypotheses are given below:

| Feature    | Mean Token Count |
| ---------- | ---------------- |
| Premise    | 14.1             |
| Hypothesis | 8.3              |

### Data Fields

- `doi`: Digital Object Identifier of the original document
- `text_id`: unique text identifier
- `text`: text excerpt from the document
- `sdg`: the SDG the text is validated against
- `label`: an integer from `0` to `17` which corresponds to the `sdg` field
- `labels_negative`: the number of volunteers who rejected the suggested SDG label
- `labels_positive`: the number of volunteers who accepted the suggested SDG label
- `agreement`: agreement score based on the formula


### Data Splits

The OSDG-CD dataset has 1 splits: _train_.

| Dataset Split | Number of Instances in Split |
| ------------- |----------------------------- |
| Train         | 32,327                       |
