### Dataset Summary

Each record in the file contains information about one particular shift that an engineer or conductor worked.  Clock-in and clock-out information, plus many statistics, are provided.

0: No accident occurred during this shift

1: An accident of type '1' occurred during this shift

2. An accident of type '2' occurred during this shift
