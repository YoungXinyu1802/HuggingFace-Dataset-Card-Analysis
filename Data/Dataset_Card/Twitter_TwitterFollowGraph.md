## TwitterFollowGraph

TwitterFollowGraph is a bipartite directed graph of users (consumer) nodes to author (producer) nodes where an edge represents a user "following" an author engagement. Each edge is binned into predetermined time chunks which are denoted with ordinals. These ordinals are contiguous and respect time ordering of engagements. In total TwitterFollowGraph has 261ùëÄ edges and 15.5ùëÄ vertices, with a max-degree of 900ùêæ and a min-degree of 5.

The data format is displayed below.

| user_index | author_index | time_chunk |
| ------------- | ------------- |  ---- |
| 1   | 2 | 1 |
| 2   | 1 | 2 |
| 3   | 3 | 2 |
