The data contains three different vehicles from CCSA (https://www.ccsa.gmu.edu/models/):
    A Toyota Yaris
    A Chevy Silverado
    And an ADS vehicle

These vehicles were tested at different speeds, and the binout files were stored.

The car models were used to develop an AI that could estimate a full frontal impact for different cars at different speeds.
This can then be used to predict the force of an impact for an Autonomous car simulator.
