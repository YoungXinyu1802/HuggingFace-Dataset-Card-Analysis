### Annotations

#### Annotation process
Four evaluators (all authors of this paper (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2021.111047)), each having at least four years of programming experience, participated in the annonation process.
We partitioned Java, Python, and Smalltalk comments equally among all evaluators based on the distribution of the language's dataset to ensure the inclusion of comments from all projects and diversified lengths. Each classification is reviewed by three evaluators. 
The details are given in the paper [Rani et al., JSS, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2021.111047)
