These orbs were generated with GLID-3, a text-to-image system (https://github.com/Jack000/glid-3)
The text prompt for many was "Orbs within orbs, concentric circles and ripples of fire (spheres and circles, roundness)"
I used a high guidance scale (10 IIRC) and generated them in batches of 64
There are two 'flavours', 'dark' and 'light' (indicated with the 'label' attribute in the dataset. The 'light' images are from a GLID-3 model I fine-tuned on some abstract art, and tend to be more pastel colors and plain shapes. The 'dark' images are from GLID-3 part way through it's training.
This dataset is intended for use in GAN training demos and other art projects. Please give attribution if you use it in your own work (and tag me @johnowhitaker so I can see what you make!)
It's also nice for other artsy things, such as this montage made up of many little orb images: https://www.easyzoom.com/imageaccess/47cab299796a45edbd98951e704cb340
