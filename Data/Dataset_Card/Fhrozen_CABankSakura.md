## Project Description

This corpus of 18 conversations is the product of six graduation theses on gender differences in students' group talk. Each conversation lasted between 12 and 35 minutes (avg. 25 minutes) resulting in an overall time of 7 hours and 30 minutes. 31 Students (19 female, 12 male) participated in the study (Table 1). The participants gathered in groups of 4 students, either of the same or the opposite sex (6 conversations with a group of 4 female students, 6 with 4 male students, and 6 conversations with 2 male and 2 female students), according to age (first and third year students) and affiliation (two academic departments). In addition, the participants of each conversation came from the same small-sized class and were well acquainted.

The participants were informed that their conversations may be transcribed and a video recorded for use in possible publication when recruited. Additionally, permission was asked once more after the transcription in cases where either private information had been displayed, or a misunderstanding concerning the nature and degree of the publication of the conversations became apparent during the conversation.

The recordings took place in a small conference room at the university between or after lectures. The participants were given a card with a conversation topic to start with, but were free to vary (topic 1 "What do you expect from an opposite sex friend?" [isee ni motomeru koto]; topic 2 "Are you a dog lover or a cat lover?" [inuha ka nekoha ka]; topic 3 "About part-time work" [arubaito ni tsuite]). The investigator was not present during the recording. The combination of participants, the topic, and the duration of the 18 conversations are given in Table 2.

The participants produced 15,449 utterances overall (female: 8,027 utterances, male: 7,422 utterances). All utterances were linked to video and transcribed in regular Japanese orthography and Latin script (Wakachi2002), and provided with morphological tags (JMOR04.1). Proper names were replaced by pseudonyms.
