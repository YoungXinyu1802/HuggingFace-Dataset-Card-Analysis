The Diachronic Spanish Sonnet Corpus (DISCO) contains sonnets in Spanish in CSV, between the 15th and the 20th centuries (4303 sonnets by 1215 authors from 22 different countries). It includes well-known authors, but also less canonized ones. 

This is a CSV compilation taken from the plain text corpus v4 published on git https://github.com/pruizf/disco/tree/v4. It includes the title, author, age and text metadata.
