### Dataset Contents

This dataset contains the concatenated scripts from the original (and best) Star Wars trilogy. The scripts are reduced to dialogue only, and are tagged with a line number and speaker.

### Dataset Disclaimer

I don't own this data; or Star Wars. But it would be cool if I did.

Star Wars is owned by Lucasfilms. I do not own any of the rights to this information.

The scripts are derived from a couple sources:

* This [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/gastonstat/StarWars) with raw files

* A [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xvivancos/star-wars-movie-scripts) put together by whoever 'Xavier' is
