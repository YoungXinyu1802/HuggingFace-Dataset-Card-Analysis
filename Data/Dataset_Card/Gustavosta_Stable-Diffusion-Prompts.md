# Stable Diffusion Dataset

This is a set of about 80,000 prompts filtered and extracted from the image finder for Stable Diffusion: "[Lexica.art](https://lexica.art/)". It was a little difficult to extract the data, since the search engine still doesn't have a public API without being protected by cloudflare.

If you want to test the model with a demo, you can go to: "[spaces/Gustavosta/MagicPrompt-Stable-Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Gustavosta/MagicPrompt-Stable-Diffusion)".

If you want to see the model, go to: "[Gustavosta/MagicPrompt-Stable-Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/Gustavosta/MagicPrompt-Stable-Diffusion)".
