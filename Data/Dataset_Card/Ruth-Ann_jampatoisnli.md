### Dataset Summary

JamPatoisNLI provides the first dataset for natural language inference in a creole language, Jamaican Patois. 
Many of the most-spoken low-resource languages are creoles. These languages commonly have a lexicon derived from 
a major world language and a distinctive grammar reflecting the languages of the original speakers and the process
of language birth by creolization. This gives them a distinctive place in exploring the effectiveness of transfer
from large monolingual or multilingual pretrained models. 

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

Natural language inference

### Languages

Jamaican Patois

### Data Fields

premise, hypothesis, label

### Data Splits

Train: 250
Val: 200
Test: 200


### Data set creation + Annotations

Premise collection: 
97% of examples from Twitter; remaining pulled from literature and online cultural website

Hypothesis construction: 
For each premise, hypothesis written by native speaker (our first author) so that pairâ€™s classification would be  E, N  or C

Label validation: 
Random sample of 100 sentence pairs double annotated by fluent speakers


### Social Impact of Dataset

JamPatoisNLI is a low-resource language dataset in an English-based Creole spoken in the Caribbean,
Jamaican Patois. The creation of the dataset contributes to expanding the scope of NLP research
to under-explored languages across the world.
