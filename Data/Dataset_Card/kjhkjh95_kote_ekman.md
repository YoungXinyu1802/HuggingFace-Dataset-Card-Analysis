# Ekman Taxomony of KOTE(Korean Online That-gul Emotions) datasets

I mapped 44 emotion types in the KOTE dataset to 7 Ekman Taxonomy (Disgust, Fear, Sadness, Surprise, Joy, + No Emotion).
For the mapping, I referred to the clustering results in the KOTE paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.05300.pdf).
The distance between each emotion and Ekman basic emotion (Disgust, Fear, Sadness, Surprise, Joy, + No Emotion) was calculated and configured to map to the nearest basic emotion.
