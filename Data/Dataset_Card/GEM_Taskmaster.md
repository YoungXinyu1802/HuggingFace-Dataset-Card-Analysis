### Link to Main Data Card

You can find the main data card on the [GEM Website](https://gem-benchmark.com/data_cards/Taskmaster).

### Dataset Summary 

This is a large task-oriented dialog dataset in which a model has to produce the response. The input contains the context and a structured representation of what the model is supposed to generate. The input is already pre-formatted as string, turning this into a pure text-to-text problem. 

You can load the dataset via:
```
import datasets
data = datasets.load_dataset('GEM/Taskmaster')
```
The data loader can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/GEM/Taskmaster).
