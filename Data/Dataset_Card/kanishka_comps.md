# Dataset Card for "COMPS"

## Dataset Description

COMPS is a dataset of minimal pair sentences in English that enables the 
testing knowledge of concepts and their properties in language models (LMs).
Specifically, it tests the ability of LMs to attribute properties to everyday 
concepts, and demonstrate reasoning compatible with property inheritance, where
subordinate concepts inherit the properties of their superordinate (hypernyms).
