## Overview
![image](trip_sample.png)
We introduce Tiered Reasoning for Intuitive Physics (TRIP), a novel commonsense reasoning dataset with dense annotations that enable multi-tiered evaluation of machinesâ€™ reasoning process.

It includes dense annotations for each story capturing multiple tiers of reasoning beyond the end task. From these annotations, we propose a tiered evaluation, where given a pair of highly similar stories (differing only by one sentence which makes one of the stories implausible), systems must jointly identify (1) the plausible story, (2) a pair of conflicting sentences in the implausible story, and (3) the underlying physical states in those sentences causing the conflict. The goal of TRIP is to enable a systematic evaluation of machine coherence toward the end task prediction of plausibility. In particular, we evaluate whether a high-level plausibility prediction can be verified based on lower-level understanding, for example, physical state changes that would support the prediction.
