### Dataset Summary

Mac-Morpho is a corpus of Brazilian Portuguese texts annotated with part-of-speech tags. 
Its first version was released in 2003 [1], and since then, two revisions have been made in order 
to improve the quality of the resource [2, 3].
The corpus is available for download split into train, development and test sections. 
These are 76%, 4% and 20% of the corpus total, respectively (the reason for the unusual numbers 
is that the corpus was first split into 80%/20% train/test, and then 5% of the train section was 
set aside for development). This split was used in [3], and new POS tagging research with Mac-Morpho 
is encouraged to follow it in order to make consistent comparisons possible.

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

An example from the Mac-Morpho dataset looks as follows:

```
{
    "id": "0",
    "pos_tags": [14, 19, 14, 15, 22, 7, 14, 9, 14, 9, 3, 15, 3, 3, 24],
    "tokens": ["Jersei", "atinge", "média", "de", "Cr$", "1,4", "milhão", "na", "venda", "da", "Pinhal", "em", "São", "Paulo", "."]
}
```

### Data Fields

- `id`: id of the sample
- `tokens`: the tokens of the example text
- `pos`: the PoS tags of each token

The PoS tags correspond to this list:
```
"PREP+PROADJ", "IN", "PREP+PRO-KS", "NPROP", "PREP+PROSUB", "KC", "PROPESS", "NUM", "PROADJ", "PREP+ART", "KS", 
"PRO-KS", "ADJ", "ADV-KS", "N", "PREP", "PROSUB", "PREP+PROPESS", "PDEN", "V", "PREP+ADV", "PCP", "CUR", "ADV", "PU", "ART"
```

### Data Splits

The data is split into train, validation and test set. The split sizes are as follow:

| Train  | Val   | Test  |
| ------ | ----- | ----- |
| 37948  | 1997  | 9987  |
