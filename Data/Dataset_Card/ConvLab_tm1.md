# Dataset Card for Taskmaster-1

- **Repository:** https://github.com/google-research-datasets/Taskmaster/tree/master/TM-1-2019
- **Paper:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.05358.pdf
- **Leaderboard:** None
- **Who transforms the dataset:** Qi Zhu(zhuq96 at gmail dot com)

To use this dataset, you need to install [ConvLab-3](https://github.com/ConvLab/ConvLab-3) platform first. Then you can load the dataset via:
```
from convlab.util import load_dataset, load_ontology, load_database

dataset = load_dataset('tm1')
ontology = load_ontology('tm1')
database = load_database('tm1')
```
For more usage please refer to [here](https://github.com/ConvLab/ConvLab-3/tree/master/data/unified_datasets).

### Dataset Summary

The original dataset consists of 13,215 task-based dialogs, including 5,507 spoken and 7,708 written dialogs created with two distinct procedures. Each conversation falls into one of six domains: ordering pizza, creating auto repair appointments, setting up ride service, ordering movie tickets, ordering coffee drinks and making restaurant reservations.

- **How to get the transformed data from original data:** 
  - Download [master.zip](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/Taskmaster/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).
  - Run `python preprocess.py` in the current directory.
- **Main changes of the transformation:**
  - Remove dialogs that are empty or only contain one speaker.
  - Split woz-dialogs into train/validation/test randomly (8:1:1). The split of self-dialogs is followed the original dataset.
  - Merge continuous turns by the same speaker (ignore repeated turns).
  - Annotate `dialogue acts` according to the original segment annotations. Add `intent` annotation (inform/accept/reject). The type of `dialogue act` is set to `non-categorical` if the original segment annotation includes a specified `slot`. Otherwise, the type is set to `binary` (and the `slot` and `value` are empty) since it means general reference to a transaction, e.g. "OK your pizza has been ordered". If there are multiple spans overlapping, we only keep the shortest one, since we found that this simple strategy can reduce the noise in annotation.
  - Add `domain`, `intent`, and `slot` descriptions.
  - Add `state` by accumulate `non-categorical dialogue acts` in the order that they appear, except those whose intents are **reject**.
  - Keep the first annotation since each conversation was annotated by two workers.
- **Annotations:**
  - dialogue acts, state.

6 domains: ['uber_lyft', 'movie_ticket', 'restaurant_reservation', 'coffee_ordering', 'pizza_ordering', 'auto_repair']
- **cat slot match**: how many values of categorical slots are in the possible values of ontology in percentage.
- **non-cat slot span**: how many values of non-categorical slots have span annotation in percentage.
