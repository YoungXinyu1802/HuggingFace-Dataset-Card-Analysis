About Dataset
This dataset is taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bolattleubayev/nursultan-nazarbayev-speech-dataset
The dataset consists of manually labelled 9341 wav files (around 14.8 hours) taken from speeches of The First President of the Republic of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev published online. 7919 files (12.1 hours) are in Russian and 1422 files (2.7 hours) in Kazakh. Minimum duration: 0.42 sec, maximum: 13.00 sec, mean: 5.71 sec.

The dataset was collected as a part of a research effort of Nazarabyev University Human-Robot Interaction Lab by Bolat Tleubayev, Ruslan Polichshuk, Zhanel Zhexenova, and Anara Sandygulova.

This is ongoing open source project, so the dataset might expand in future.

The .csv files are separated by '|' instead of ',' to avoid confusion with punctuation.
