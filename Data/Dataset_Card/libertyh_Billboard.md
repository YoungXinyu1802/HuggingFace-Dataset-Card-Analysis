Flowers 
Miley Cyrus
We were good, we were gold
Kind of dream that can't be sold
We were right, 'til we weren't
Built a home and watched it burn
Mm, I didn't wanna leave you, I didn't wanna lie
Started to cry, but then remembered, I
I can buy myself flowers
Write my name in the sand
Talk to myself for hours
Say things you don't understand
I can take myself dancing
And I can hold my own hand
Yeah, I can love me better than you can
Can love me better, I can love me better, baby
Can love me better, I can love me better, baby
Paint my nails, cherry-red
Match the roses that you left
No remorse, no regret
I forgive every word you said
Ooh, I didn't wanna leave you, baby, I didn't wanna fight
Started to cry, but then remembered, I
I can buy myself flowers
Write my name in the sand
Talk to myself for hours, yeah
Say things you don't understand
I can take myself dancing, yeah
I can hold my own hand
Yeah, I can love me better than you can

Kill Bill 
SZA
I'm still a fan even though I was salty
Hate to see you with some other broad, know you happy
Hate to see you happy if I'm not the one driving
I'm so mature, I'm so mature
I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men
I don't want none, I just want you
If I can't have you, no one should
I might
I might kill my ex, not the best idea
His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?
I might kill my ex, I still love him though
Rather be in jail than alone
I get the sense that it's a lost cause
I get the sense that you might really love her
The text gon' be evidence, this text is evidence
I tried to ration with you, no murders, no crimes of passion, but damn
You was out of reach
You was at the farmer's market with your perfect peach
Now I'm in amazement, playing on my patience
Now you laying face-down, got me singing over a beat
I'm so mature, I'm so mature
I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men
I don't want none, I just want you
If I can't have you, no one will
(I might)
I might kill my ex, not the best idea
His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?
I might kill my ex, I still love him though
Rather be in jail than alone
I did it all for love (love)
I did it all on no drugs (drugs)
I did all of this sober
I did it all for us, oh
I did it all for love (love)
I did it all of this on no drugs (drugs)
I did all of this sober
Don't you know I did it all for us? (I'll kill your ass tonight)
Uh, I just killed my ex (my ex)
Not the best idea (idea)
Killed his girlfriend next, how'd I get here?
I just killed my ex (my ex)
I still love him, though (I do)
Rather be in Hell than alone

Boyâ€™s A Liar, Pt. 2
PinkPantheress & Ice Spice
Take a look inside your heart
Is there any room for me?
I won't have to hold my breath
'Til you get down on one knee
Because you only want to hold me
When I'm looking good enough
Did you ever feel me?
Would you ever picture us?
Every time I pull my hair
Was only out of fear
That you'll find me ugly
And one day you'll disappear because
What's the point of crying?
It was never even love
Did you ever want me?
Was I ever good enough?
The, the boy's a liar
The boy's a liar
He doesn't see ya
You're not lookin' at me, boy

So I tell him it's one of me, he makin' fun of me (ha-ha)
His girl is a bum to me (grrah)
Like that boy is a cap
Sayin' he home, but I know where he at, like
Bet he blowin' her back
Thinkin' 'bout me 'cause he know that ass fat (damn)
And it been what it been (huh)
Callin' his phone like, "Yo, send me your pin"
Duckin' my shit, 'cause he know what I'm on (grrah)
But when he hit me, I'm not gon' respond (grrah)
But I don't sleep enough without you
And I can't eat enough without you (huh)
If you don't speak, does that mean we're through? (Huh)
Don't like sneaky shit that you do (grrah)

Creepin'
Metro Boomin, The Weeknd & 21 Savage
Oooh
Just can't believe this man
(Metro Boomin want some more nigga)
Somebody said they saw you
The person you were kissing wasn't me
And I would never ask you, I just kept it to myself
I don't wanna know, if you're playing me
Keep it on the low
Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you creeping, please don't let it show
Oh baby, I don't wanna know
I think about it when I hold you
When looking in your eyes, I can't believe
And I don't need to know the truth
But baby keep it to yourself
I don't wanna know, if you're playing me
Keep it on the low
Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you creeping, please don't let it show
Oh baby, I don't wanna know
Did he touch you better than me? (touch you better than me?)
Did he watch you fall asleep (watch you fall asleep?)
Did you show him all those things that you used to do to me?
If you're better off that way (better off that way)
Baby all that I can say (all that I can say)
If you're gonna do your thing, then don't come back to me
Ooh
Woah, woah, woah
21
Had me crushing, I was cuffing like the precinct
How you go from housewife to a sneaky link
Got you ridin round in all types of benz's and rovers
Girl you used to ride in a rinky dink
I'm the one put you in Eliante (on God)
Fashion Nova model, I put you on the runway (on God)
You was rocking coach bags, got you chanaynay
Side bitch in frisco, I call her my bae bae (21)
I got a girl but I still feel alone
If you playing me that mean my home aint home
Having nightmares of going through your phone (21)
Can't even record you got me out my zone
I don't wanna know, if you're playing me
Keep it on the low
Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you creeping, please don't let it show
Oh baby
I don't wanna know, if you're playing me
Keep it on the low
Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you creeping, please don't let it show
Oh baby I don't wanna know
If you creeping just don't let me find out (on God)
Get a hotel never bring him to the house (on God)
If you're better off that way (better off that way)
Baby all that I can say (all that I can say)
If you're gonna do your thing, then don't come back to me



Last Night
Morgan Wallen
Last night we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But baby, baby somethin's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night
I kiss your lips
Make you grip the sheets with your fingertips
Last bottle of Jack we split a fifth
Just talk about life goin' sip for sip
You, you know you love to fight
And I say shit I don't mean
But I'm still gon' wake up wantin' you and me
I know that last night we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But baby, baby somethin's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night
No way it was our last night
No way it was the last night that we break up
I see your tail lights in the dust
You call your momma, I call your bluff
In the middle of the night, pull it right back up
Yeah my, my friends say let her go
Your friends say what the hell
I wouldn't trade your kind of love for nothin' else
Oh baby, last night we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But baby, baby somethin's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night, we said we'd had enough
I can't remember everything we said but we said too much
I know you packed your shit and slammed the door right before you left
But baby, baby somethin's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night
No way it was our last night
I know you said this time you really weren't coming back again
But baby, baby somethin's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night
No way it was our last night

Die For You
The Weeknd & Ariana Grande
I'm findin' ways to articulate the feelin' I'm goin' through
I just can't say I don't love you
'Cause I love you, yeah
It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold
But tonight, I'm gon' let you know
Let me tell the truth
Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah
You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
You're scared to be lonely, 'specially in the night
I'm scared that I'll miss you, happens every time
I don't want this feelin', I can't afford love
I try to find a reason to pull us apart
It ain't workin', 'cause you're perfect, and I know that you're worth it
I can't walk away, oh
Even though we're goin' through it
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind
'Cause baby, I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
I'm findin' ways to manipulate the feelin' you're goin' through
But, baby girl, I'm not blamin' you
Just don't blame me, too, yeah
'Cause I can't take this pain forever
And you won't find no one that's better
'Cause I'm right for you, babe
I think I'm right for you, babe
You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
It ain't workin', 'cause you're perfect, and I know that you're worth it
I can't walk away, oh
Even though we're goin' through it
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind
'Cause baby, I would die for you, uh
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
I would die for you, I would lie for you
Keep it real with you, I would kill for you
My baby
I'm just sayin', yeah
I would die for you, I would lie for you
Keep it real with you, I would kill for you
My baby
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na, ooh
Even though we're goin' through it
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind
'Cause baby, I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah (oh, babe)

Ho-ee-oh-ee-ome, so he can get that
Mummy don't know daddy's getting hot
At the body shop, doing something unholy (woo)
Mmm, daddy, daddy, if you want it, drop the add'y (yuh)
Give me love, give me Fendi, my Balenciaga daddy

Anti-Hero
Taylor Swift

I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis (tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)
It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
At tea time, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman? (Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)
It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At tea time, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
I have this dream my daughter in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out
"She's laughing up at us from hell"
It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi, everybody agrees, everybody agrees
It's me, hi (hi), I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At tea (tea) time (time), everybody agrees (everybody agrees)
I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

As It Was
Harry Styles
Holdin' me back
Gravity's holdin' me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don't we leave it at that?
Nothin' to say
When everything gets in the way
Seems you cannot be replaced
And I'm the one who will stay, oh
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same
Answer the phone
"Harry, you're no good alone
Why are you sittin' at home on the floor?
What kind of pills are you on?"
Ringin' the bell
And nobody's comin' to help
Your daddy lives by himself
He just wants to know that you're well, oh
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same
Go home, get ahead, light-speed internet
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
Leave America, two kids follow her
I don't wanna talk about who's doin' it first
As it was
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was

Must've finally made their way on through
I thought you should know
I got me a new girl down there in Jefferson City, and
She lets me fish whenever I want to
Yeah, I'm still proud of where I came from
Still your only damn son
Can you believe I'm on the radio?
Just thought you should know, thought you should know, thought you should know
Yeah, I know you've been worrying 'bout me
You've been losing sleep since '93

Must've finally made their way on through

Turns out she's a lot like you
Yeah, I'm still proud of where I came from
Still your only damn son

Just thought you should know, thought you should know, thought you should know
I thought you should know, thought you should know
I thought you should know, thought you should know, thought you should know


Rock And A Hard Place
Bailey Zimmerman
We've been swingin' and missin'
It ain't broke yet, but damn, it needs fixin'
Been a while since your kiss felt like kissin'
It's just different
We've been talkin' 'bout forever since we've been together
Somethin' 'bout a ring makes you think we're better off with
All this but we're caught in
Between a rock and a hard place
Red wine and mistakes
Tears rollin' down your face
When I walked out that door
And that's when I lost it
A midnight in Austin
Damn, I'm exhausted
What the hell's this all for?
Is this where it mends or it breaks?
Between a rock and a hard place
For the record, shit
Throwin' in the towel takes some effort
So I'd rather ride it out for better weather
Together
Between a rock and a hard place
Red wine and mistakes
Tears rollin' down your face
When I walked out that door
And that's when I lost it
A midnight in Austin
Damn, I'm exhausted
What the hell's this all for?
Is this where it mends or it breaks?
Between a rock and a hard place
We've been talkin' 'bout forever since we've been together
Something 'bout a ring makes you think we're better off with
All this but we're caught in
Between a rock and a hard place
Tears rollin' down your face
As I walked out that door
And that's when I lost it
Midnight in Austin
Damn, I'm exhausted
What the hell's this all for?
Is this where it mends or it breaks?
How much more of this can we take?

Escapism
RAYE Featuring 070 Shake
Sleazin' and teasin', I'm sittin' on him
All of my diamonds are drippin' on him
I met him at the bar, it was 12 or somethin'
I ordered two more wines, 'cause tonight, I want him
A little context if you care to listen
I find myself in a shit position
The man that I love sat me down last night
And he told me that it's over, dumb decision
And I don't wanna feel how my heart is rippin'
In fact, I don't wanna feel, so I stick to sippin'
And I'm out on the town with a simple mission
In my little black dress, and this shit is sittin'
Just a heart broke bitch, high heels, six inch
In the back of the nightclub, sippin' champagne
I don't trust any of these bitches I'm with
In the back of the taxi, sniffin' cocaine
Drunk calls, drunk texts, drunk tears, drunk sex
I was lookin' for a man who was on the same page
Now it's back to the intro, back to the bar
To the Bentley, to the hotel, to my old ways
'Cause I don't wanna feel how I did last night
I don't wanna feel how I did last night
Doctor, doctor, anything, please
Doctor, doctor, have mercy on me, take this pain away
You're asking me my symptoms, doctor, I don't wanna feel
Toke this joint how I'm blowin' this steam
Back to my ways like 2019
Not 24 hours since my ex did dead it
I got a new man on me, it's about to get sweaty
Last night really was the cherry on the cake
Been some dark days lately and I'm finding it crippling
Excuse my state, I'm as high as your hopes
That you'll make it to my bed, get me hot and sizzling
If I take a step back to see the glass half full
At least it's the Prada two-piece that I'm trippin' in
And I'm already actin' like a dick, know what I mean?
So you might as well stick it in
Just a heart broke bitch, high heels, six inch
In the back of the nightclub, sippin' champagne
I don't trust any of these bitches I'm with
In the back of the taxi, sniffin' cocaine
Drunk calls, drunk texts, drunk tears, drunk sex
I was lookin' for a man who was on the same page
Now it's back to the intro, back to the bar
To the Bentley, to the hotel, to my old ways
'Cause I don't wanna feel how I did last night
I don't wanna feel how I did last night
Doctor, doctor, anything, please
Doctor, doctor, have mercy on me, take this pain away
You're asking me my symptoms, doctor, I don't wanna feel, mm (what?)
'Cause I don't wanna feel like I felt last night
I don't wanna feel like I felt last night
Be at peace with the things you can't change (last night)
I'll be naked when I leave and I was naked when I came, yeah
Out of reach, out of touch, too numb, I don't feel no way
Toast up, so what? Street small, but it go both ways
So you'll run, yeah, but you'll never escape
Sunset in the maze (you're asking me my symptoms, doctor, I don't wanna feel)
I don't wanna feel how I did last night
I don't wanna feel how I did last night, oh
Doctor, doctor, anything, please
Doctor, doctor, have mercy on me
You're asking me my symptoms, doctor, I don't wanna feel
I don't wanna feel how I did last night
I don't wanna feel how I did last night
I don't wanna feel how I did last night
Mm, lipstick smudged like modern art
I don't know where the fuck I am or who's drivin' the fuckin' car
Speedin' down the highway, sippin'
Mixin' pills with the liquor 'cah fuck these feelings
I left everyone I love on read (uh-huh)
Spilling secrets to the stranger in my bed (uh-huh)
I remember nothing, so there's nothing to regret (uh-huh)
Other than this 4-4 kick drum poundin' in my head




Going, Going, Gone
Luke Combs
Some things in life are meant to fly
And others, they were born to run
You can't tie them up and leavin'
Like the changing of the seasons
Good things, they come and then they go
Like a runaway Southbound train
Like an Arizona desert rain
Like lightning in the sky
Like fireworks in July
Like a left field homerun ball
Like a whiskey shot at last call
It's like she was made for moving on
That girl is going, going, gone
I can say it wasn't meant to be
But maybe meant to be is misunderstood
I can't hold on to letting go
Change the way the river flows
Lovin' her's like roping in the wind
Like a runaway Southbound train
Like an Arizona desert rain
Like lightning in the sky
Like fireworks in July
Like a left field homerun ball
Like a whiskey shot at last call
It's like she was made for moving on
That girl is going, going, gone
She ain't got one bit of stick around
There's no sense in tryin' to slow her down
Like a runaway Southbound train
Like an Arizona desert rain
Like lightning in the sky
Like fireworks in July
Like a left field homerun ball
Like a whiskey shot at last call
It's like she was made for moving on
That girl is going, going, gone
Going, going, gone
Going, going, gone

Candy in the cup, gotta get paid

Piss on your casket, shoot at your broad
Do you something nasty, roll you in a 'gar
Bitch get graphic, fuck me in a car
I get you a brand new Rollie tomorrow
I put that brand new Rollie on your arm
Ain't movin' slow but I'm still on oil
Tennis bracelets and they came with the frost
Cuban links all the way up to your jaw
Step up the swag when I step on a broad
Two dollar half, ooh, that's the cheapest one
Stackin' these hundreds up, like coupons
Told you from the beginning, upper echelon
And I get to stackin' up, I'm untouchable
I get to represent, money multiple
I'm at the top of the charts, unapproachable
Bread by the loaf, turbo the motor
Tic-tac-toe, killing all the vultures
Selling elbows, bitch do yoga
I deserve awards, serving these boulders
A hundred grand large when I shop, that's the total
Fill up the garage, bitch, I'm a mogul
Ain't no facadin', ain't no fugazi
I drop it off, I get paid
Drop top Royce, I'm going crazy
I push off, smoking on haze
Not tryna floss, Cartier shades
Candy in the cup, gotta get paid
King in the streets, young nigga made
Sprayin' up the crowd, take it to the grave
Ain't havin' problems, I'm sippin' the bar
Shoutout to Dallas, my bitch is a star
Nigga get rich, ready take you to war
Piss on your casket, shoot at your broad
Do you something nasty, roll you in a 'gar
Bitch get graphic, fuck me in a car
I get you a brand new Rollie tomorrow
I put that brand new Rollie on your arm
Ain't movin' slow but I'm still on oil
Tennis bracelets and they came with the frost
Cuban links all the way up to your jaw
Step up the swag when I step on a broad
Dark Knight feeling, die or be a hero
Or live long enough to see yourself become a villain
Soon as you up, these niggas wanna bring you down
The weight of the world sit on my shoulders, hold the crown
I ain't got a cape so I can't save you now
Niggas wanna hate, rather see you drown (yeah)
And the world keep spinnin' (yeah)
Like I'm the only one in it (am I the only one?) Why?
They don't wanna see you winnin' (no, no, no, no)
So who's really the villain? (Yeah)
(Whooo, who's the villain? Who's the villain?)
(Live long enough to see yourself become a villain)


Something In The Orange
Zach Bryan
It'll be fine by dusk light I'm telling you, baby
These things eat at your bones and drive your young mind crazy
But when you place your head between my collar and jaw
I don't know much but there's no weight at all
And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
'Cause if I say I miss you I know that you won't
But I miss you in the mornings when I see the sun
Something in the orange tells me we're not done
To you I'm just a man, to me you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again
Something in the orange tells me you're never coming home
I need to hear you say you've been waitin' all night
There's orange dancing in your eyes from bulb light
Your voice only trembles when you try to speak
Take me back to us dancing, this wood used to creak
To you I'm just a man, to me you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again
Something in the orange tells me you're never coming home
To you I'm just a man, to me you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again
Something in the orange tells me you're never coming home
If you leave today, I'll just stare at the way
The orange touches all things around
The grass, trees and dew, how I just hate you
Please turn those headlights around
Please turn those headlights around


Golden Hour
JVKE
It was just two lovers
Sittin' in the car, listening to Blonde
Fallin' for each other
Pink and orange skies, feelin' super childish
No Donald Glover
Missed call from my mother
Like, "Where you at tonight?" Got no alibi
I was all alone with the love of my life
She's got glitter for skin
My radiant beam in the night
I don't need no light to see you
Shine
It's your golden hour (oh)
You slow down time
In your golden hour (oh)
We were just two lovers
Feet up on the dash, drivin' nowhere fast
Burnin' through the summer
Radio on blast, make the moment last
She got solar power
Minutes feel like hours
She knew she was the baddest, can you even imagine
Fallin' like I did?
For the love of my life
She's got glow on her face
A glorious look in her eyes
My angel of light
I was all alone with the love of my life
She's got glitter for skin
My radiant beam in the night
I don't need no light to see you
Shine
It's your golden hour (oh)
You slow down time
In your golden hour (oh)




Sure Thing
Migue
Love you like a brother
Treat you like a friend
Respect you like a lover
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

You could bet that, never gotta sweat that (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You could bet that, never gotta sweat that
You could bet that, never gotta sweat that (yeah)
If you be the cash
I'll be the rubber band
You be the match
I will be a fuse, boom
Painter, baby, you could be the muse
I'm the reporter, baby, you could be the news
'Cause you're the cigarette and I'm the smoker
We raise a bet 'cause you're the joker
Checked off, you are the chalk
And I can be the blackboard
You can be the talk
And I can be the walk, yeah
Even when the sky comes falling
Even when the sun don't shine
I got faith in you and I

Heart Like A Truck
Lainey Wilson
I never stay in one place too long
A dirt road's singing me a siren song
I gotta find a field
I need to spin my wheels
I got a hankering for four wide tires
And I can't help it it's the way I'm wired
'Fore you get too close
Boy you need to know
I got a heart like a truck
It's been drug through the mud
Runs on dreams and gasoline
And that ole highway holds the key
It's got a lead foot down when it's leaving
Lord knows it's taken a hell of a beating
A little bit of love is all that it's needing
But it's good as it is tough
I got a heart like a truck
There ain't no breaking when I throw it in drive
Don't always keep it in between the lines
If you're ready for a ride pedal down state of mind
Boy I tell you what
You better buckle up
I got a heart like a truck
It's been drug through the mud
Runs on dreams and gasoline
And that ole highway holds the key
It's got a lead foot down when it's leaving
Lord knows it's taken a hell of a beating
A little bit of love is all that it's needing
But it's good as it is tough
I got a heart like a truck
Go on and see if you can knock off the dust yea
Shine it up revv it up and let it run yea
It gets a high riding off into the sun yea
I got a heart like a truck
It's been drug through the mud
Runs on dreams and gasoline
And that ole highway holds the key
It's got a lead foot down when it's leaving
Lord knows it's taken a hell of a beating
A little bit of love is all that it's needing
But it's good as it is tough
I got a heart like a truck
Go on and see if you can knock off the dust yea
Shine it up revv it up and let it run yea
It gets a high riding off into the sun yea
It gets a high riding off into the sun


Bad Habit
Steve Lacy
wanted me
I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me
I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me
What you, ooh, uh, what you do?
Made a move, coulda made a move
If I knew I'd be with you
Is it too late to pursue?
I bite my tongue, it's a bad habit
Kinda mad that I didn't take a stab at it
Thought you were too good for me, my dear
Never gave me time of day, my dear
It's okay, things happen for
Reasons that I think are sure, yeah
I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me
I wish I knew (oh), I wish I knew you wanted me
I wish I knew (yeah), I wish I knew you wanted me (oh)
I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me
Say to me (please just say to me)
If you still want it
I wish you wouldn't play with me
I wanna know (oh no)
Uh, can I bite your tongue like my bad habit?
Would you mind if I tried to make a pass at it?
Were you not too good for me, my dear?
Funny you come back to me, my dear
It's okay, things happen for
Reasons that I can't ignore, yeah
I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me
I wish I knew (wish I knew), I wish I knew you wanted me (oh)
You can't surprise a Gemini
I'm everywhere, I'm cross-eyed, and
Now that you're back, I can't decide
If I decide if you're invited
You always knew the way to wow me
Fuck around, get tongue-tied, and
I turn it on, I make it rowdy
Then carry on, but I'm not hidin'
You grabbin' me hard 'cause you know what you found
Is biscuits, is gravy, babe, ah-ah
You can't surprise a Gemini
But you know it's biscuits, is gravy, babe
I knew you'd come back around
'Cause you know it's biscuits, it's gravy, babe
Let's fuck in the back of the mall, lose control
Go stupid, go crazy, babe
I know I'll be in your heart 'til the end
You'll miss me, don't beg me, babe




Until I Found You
Stephen Sanchez
Georgia, wrap me up in all your-
I want you in my arms
Oh, let me hold you
I'll never let you go again like I did
Oh, I used to say
"I would never fall in love again until I found her"
I said, "I would never fall unless it's you I fall into"
I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her
I found you
Heaven, when I held you again
How could we ever just be friends?
I would rather die than let you go
Juliet to your Romeo, how I heard you say
"I would never fall in love again until I found her"
I said, "I would never fall unless it's you I fall into"
I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her
I found you
I would never fall in love again until I found her
I said, "I would never fall unless it's you I fall into"
I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her
I found you


Shirt
SZA
Kiss me, dangerous
Been so lost without you all around me
Get anxious
Lead me, don't look back, it's all about you
In the dark right now
Feeling lost, but I like it
Comfort in my sins, and all about me
All I got right now
Feel the taste of resentment
Simmer in my skin, it's all about
Blood stain on my shirt, new bitch on my nerves
Old nigga got curved, going back on my word
Damn, bitch, you so thirsty
Still don't know my worth, still stressing perfection
Let you all in my mental, got me looking too desperate
Damn, you ain't deserve
Broad day, sunshine, I'll find a way to fuck it up still
Can't cry about the shit that I can't change
Just my mind, gotta get outta here
Tough crowd, I hate it, can't stay
In the dark right now
Feeling lost, but I like it
Comfort in my sins, and all about me
All I got right now
Feel the taste of resentment
Simmer in my skin, it's all about
Blood stain on my shirt, new bitch on my nerves
Old nigga got curved, going back on my word
Damn, bitch, you so thirsty
Still don't know my worth, still stressing perfection
Let you all in my mental, got me looking too desperate
Damn
It's what you say and how you do me
How I'm 'posed to trust, baby? 'Posed to love?
It ain't 'posed to hurt this way, all I need is the best of you
How I got to say it? Give me all of you
In the dark right now
Feeling lost, but I like it
Comfort in my sins, and all about me
All I got right now
Feel the taste of resentment
Simmer in my skin, it's all about
Blood stain on my shirt, new bitch on my nerves
Old nigga got curved, going back on my word

Damn, you ain't deserve




Snooze
SZA
I'll touch that fire for you
I do that three four times again, I testify for you
I told that lie, I'd kill that bitch
I do what all of them around you scared to do, I'm not
Long as you juggin' out here for me, I got it
Mobbin', schemin', lootin', hide your bodies
Long as you dreamin' 'bout me, ain't no problem
I don't got nobody, just with you right now
Tell the truth, I look better under you
I can't lose when I'm with you
How can I snooze and miss the moment?
You just too important
Nobody do body like you do
I can't lose when I'm with you
I can't just snooze and miss the moment
You just too important
Nobody do body like you do, you do
In the droptop ride with you, I feel like Scarface (Scarface)
Like that white bitch with the bob, I'll be your main one (main one)
Let's take this argument back up to place
Sex remind you, I'm nonviolent, I'm your day one
We ain't had shit, yeah, it was magic, yeah
Smash and grab shit, yeah
Nasty habits take a hold when you not here
Ain't a home when you not here
Hard to grow when you not here, I'm sayin'
I can't lose when I'm with you
How can I snooze and miss the moment?
You just too important
Nobody do body like you do
I can't lose when I'm with you
How can I snooze and miss the moment?
You just too important
Nobody do body like you do, you do
Main one ridin'
How you frontin' on me and I'm the main one tryin'?
How you blame it on me and you the main one lyin'?
How you threatenin' to leave and I'm the main one cryin'?
Just tryna be your everything
Main one ridin'
How you frontin' on me and I'm the main one tryin'?
How you blame it on me and you the main one lyin'?
How you threatenin' to leave and I'm the main one cryin'?
I can't lose when I'm with you, ooh
How can I snooze and miss the moment?
You just too important
Nobody do body like you do

Holding back, no
Go without you
I don't wanna be with you
Uh, uh (ayy, 40, what that do?)
Lil Wooski ain't your average teen, he see the opps, gon' bang it out
He know exactly how to hit they block like that's his favorite route
Ayy, lil' nigga, if you send some shots, you better make it count
RPs touch his brain cells, rearrange his scalp
They killed Lamp
He took three with him, they all know what your name about
Ain't see you in so long, it's like your voice is slowly fadin' out
Love my niggas right or wrong, no, I would never trade 'em out
Ain't thuggin' 'cause he mean it, these lil' niggas in a race for clout
Block died, we threw up X's, TimTim died, we threw up T's
Twin 'nem died, we bangin' L's, I wish that they ain't never leave
For Killer, K's to the brain, I'm scorin' if I catch the G's
Forever stuntin' like I'm Durb, I keep a few tricks up my sleeve
God, I know I'm nothin' like them
I'm just different, I'm built different
I feel as if we all got a purpose and we all special in some way
But me, my potential is unmatched
I'm the chosen one
But only time'll tell, long live the guys
Uh
Say, "Fuck the opposites, " but deep down, we really all alike
Since the elementary, our elders gave us small advice
This shit could lead to death and jail, it's crazy how they all was right
I was playin' AAU with Ed, it was ball is life
Wish I could've warned him in advance 'fore he lost his life
Game time, call troopers for backup before we call for Christ
Was real to him whole time while he sharpened his knife
He put it in my back for racks, ain't know his heart had a price
Everything done in the dark gon' come to light
Tryna choose your thoughts over your feelings, that's the hardest fight
Had to prove 'em wrong, they said my dreams was out of sight
Now it's 50K up in my jeans on chartered flights
And we rock the hardest ice
Holding back, no
Go without you
I don't wanna be with you, yeah

Love You Anyway
Luke Coombs
The parts of me I gave away
Was honestly a huge mistake
An apology from you'd be great
But nothing between us will ever be the same
Do you wanna see inside my heart?
Inside my heart
It's what you took from me at the start
To breaking it apart
Now I have to love you from far away
But I want you to stay in my arms
Why don't you wanna put down the blade?
I can't keep on hiding these scars
That you made, that you gave
That's why I love you from far away
That you gave, that you made
That's why I love you from far away
My family still brings up your name
So I threw our pictures in the fireplace
And watched them burn right threw your face
While I cried my tears 'til no more came
Do you wanna see inside my heart?
Inside my heart
It's what you took from me at the start
To breaking it apart
Now I have to love you from far away
I know I told you I'd stay when its hard
But you haven't put down the blade
I'm getting tired of hiding these scars
We said we're meant to be
But we've come to this
When I love to see what we could've been
But we won't know, oh
Oh, we'll never know
Now I have to love you from far away
But I want you to stay in my arms
Since you couldn't put down the blade
I'm done hiding all of these scars

Wait In The Truck
HARDY Featuring Lainey Wilson
I got turned around in some little town
I'd never been to before
Working my way through a middle-of-June
Midnight thunderstorm
There was something in the headlights
It stopped me on a dime
Well, she was scared to death, so I said
"Climb in, " and then she climbed
Oh, yeah
Well, she was bruised and broke from head to toe
With a tear in her blood-stained shirt
She didn't tell the whole truth, but she didn't have to
I knew what had happened to her
I didn't load her down with questions
That girl had been through enough
I just threw it in drive, looked in those eyes
And I asked her where he was
I don't know if he's an angel
'Cause angels don't do what he did
He was hellbent to find the man behind
All the whiskey scars I hid
I never thought my day of justice
Would come from a judge under a seat
But I knew right then I'd never get hit again
When he said to me
"Wait in the truck
Just wait in the truck"
Well, I knocked and knocked and no one came
So I kicked in his double-wide door
I let the hammer drop before he got
To that 12 he was reaching for
I didn't try to hide my pistol
I didn't even try to run
I just sat on the porch, smoking one of his cigarettes
And waited for the cops to come
I don't know if he's an angel
'Cause angels don't do what he did
He was hellbent to find the man behind
All the whiskey scars I hid
I never thought my day of justice
Would come from a judge under a seat
But I knew right then I'd never get hit again
When he said to me
"Wait in the truck
Just wait in the truck"
Whoa (whoa)
Have mercy on me, Lord
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on me (hey), Lord
It's been 60 months and she still comes
To see me from time to time
It was worth the price, to see a brighter side
Of the girl I picked up that night
And I might be here forever
It ain't paradise, that's true
But it's whole hell of a lot better
Than the place I sent him to, yeah
Wait in the truck (have mercy on me)
Just wait in the truck
(Have mercy, have mercy, have mercy on me)
Wait in the truck (Lord, have mercy)
Just wait in the truck
have mercy on me, Lord
Have mercy on me
(Have mercy, have mercy, have mercy on me) have mercy on me, Lord
Have mercy on me
(Have mercy, have mercy, have mercy on me) wait in the truck
Just wait in the truck
(Have mercy, have mercy, have mercy on me) wait in the truck
Just wait in the truck (please have me mercy)


She Had Me At Heads Carolina
Cole Swindell
I was out with the boys, catchin' up at a neon light
Didn't know 'til we walked in, it was karaoke night
She was in a circle of girls, chasin' a shot with a lime
She was laughin', they were darin' her to get on the mic
One of 'em walked up and turned in her name
Next thing I knew, man, she was up on the stage, singin'
"Heads Carolina, tails California"
Maybe she'd fall for a boy from South Georgia
She's got the bar in the palm of her hand
And she's a '90s country fan like I am
Hey, I got a Chevy, she can flip a quarter
I'd drive her anywhere from here to California
When this song is over, I gotta find her
'Cause she had me at "Heads Carolina"
Yeah, she knew every word by heart, didn't need no screen, no
I was raisin' my glass up for her, I saw her smilin' at me, yeah
She had me down in the front by the end of verse two
Like there wasn't no-one else in the room, we were singin'
"Heads Carolina, tails California"
Maybe she'd fall for a boy from South Georgia
She's got the bar in the palm of her hand
And she's a '90s country fan like I am
Hey, I got a Chevy, she can flip a quarter
I'd drive her anywhere from here to California
When this song is over, I gotta find her
'Cause she had me at "Heads Carolina"
Yeah, I bought her a round, and we talked 'til the lights came on
I still see that girl every time I hear that song
"Heads Carolina, tails California"
Maybe she'd fall for a boy from South Georgia
She's got the bar in the palm of her hand
And she's a '90s country fan like I am
Hey, I got a Chevy, she can flip a quarter
I'd drive her anywhere from here to California
When this song is over, I gotta find her
'Cause she had me at "Heads Carolina"
Yeah, she had me at "Heads Carolina" (somewhere greener, somewhere warmer)
(Heads Carolina, tails California)
Yeah (somewhere greener, somewhere warmer)
(Heads Carolina)
(Somewhere together, I've got a quarter)
(Heads Carolina, tails California)


Dawns
Zach Bryan Featuring Maggie Rogers
Wake me up, when the season's gone
'Cause, I've wasted all my dawns, on you
So, what do I do
Oh, what I do
I get fucked up, just 'cause I'm scared
Love's just another drug, I have grown a victim to
So, what do I do
Oh, what do I do
All is fair, in love and war
So, what the hell are we even fightin' for
I'm on your front porch, beggin' for my dawns, back
Give my God damn records, and my clothes, back
'Cause, I'm through
Oh, how I'm through
And, by the time she wakes
I'll be halfway, to my mama's home
It just dawned on me
Life is as fleeting, as the passin' dawn
And, it was my mistake
'Cause, she never said a thing, about Jesus
I miss my mother's southern drawl
And, her prayin', through the walls, in the evenin
Give me my dawns, back
Everything that dies, makes it's way, back
I lost her, last July, in a heart attack
I need one small victory, mmm
Give me my dawns, back
'Cause, everything that dies, makes it's way, on back
I lost her, last July, in a heart attack
I need one, small victory
Wake me up, when the season's gone
'Cause, I've wasted all my dawns, on you
So, what do I do
Oh, what I do
And, by the time he wakes
I'll be halfway, to my best friend's home
It just dawned on me
Life is as fleeting, as the passin' dawn
And, I shoulda told him twice
I believe in something bigger, than both of us
I miss goin' out to bars, shootin' stars
Not worryin', 'bout what's left of us, mmm
Give me my dawns, back
Everything that dies, makes it's way, on back
I lost her, last July, in a heart attack
I need one small victory, mmm
Give me my dawns, back
Everything that dies, makes it's way, on back
I lost her, last July, in a heart attack
I need one small victory
Ooh
Ooh, ooh
I got fucked up, just 'cause I'm scared
Love's just another drug, I have grown a victim to
What do I do
Oh, what do I do


What My World Spins Around
Jordan Davis
I love a first cast when the water's glass and the line starts to run
Or that first sip of a cold beer when the working week's done
I love the twilight in the morning 'fore the day wakes up
With the windows down on the first ride in a paid up truck
And I love a slow down in a beach town with an ocean view
And I love a first fall Saturday trip down to Baton Rouge
And I love a six string with the stars out and the campfire glow
But girl, that don't even come close
To the way that it feels when you lean in and kiss me
The way that you dance when you get kinda tipsy
I'm wrapped 'round your finger like this ring I'm wearing
That look in your eye, girl, when you catch me staring
And I don't even know what it is but now that I found it
I can't imagine me living without this
Back forty view on our piece of ground
Watching you watch the sun going down
That's what my world spins around
Well, I finally get it now, when they say you know you know
And yeah, girl, you had me from that first hello
And the only thing better is Heaven above
But until I get there, I'll never get enough of
The way that it feels when you lean in and kiss me
The way that you dance when you get kinda tipsy
I'm wrapped 'round your finger like this ring I'm wearing
That look in your eye, girl, when you catch me staring and
I don't even know what it is but now that I found it
I can't imagine me living without this
Back forty view on our piece of ground
Watching you watch the sun going down
That's what my world spins around
What my world spins around
Oh, yeah
The way that it feels when you lean in and kiss me
The way that you dance when you get kinda tipsy
And I'm wrapped 'round your finger like this ring I'm wearing
And that look in your eye, girl, when you catch me staring and
I don't even know what it is but now that I found it
I can't imagine me living without this
Back forty view on our piece of ground
Watching you watch the sun going down
That's what my world spins around
You're what my world spins around
What my world spins around

Nobody Gets Me
SZA
Took a long vacation, no makeup, just Jay-Z
You were balls deep, now we beefin', had me butt-naked at the MGM
So wasted screamin', "Fuck that, " love me now, but I'm anythin'
Hurry now, baby, stick it in 'fore the memories get to kickin' in
It's too late, I don't wanna lose what's left of you
How am I supposed to tell ya?
I don't wanna see you with anyone but me
Nobody gets me like you
How am I supposed to let you go?
Only like myself when I'm with you
Nobody gets me, you do (do)
You do
Nobody gets me, you do (do)
You do
Nobody gets me, you do
You do, nobody gets me, you do
Took me out to the ballet
You proposÐµd, I went on the road
You was feelin' empty, so you lÐµft me
Now I'm stuck dealin' with a deadbeat
If I'm real, I deserve less
If I was you, I wouldn't take me back
I pretend when I'm with a man, it's you
And I know that it's too late
I don't wanna lose what's left of you
How am I supposed to tell ya?
I don't wanna see you with anyone but me
Nobody gets me like you
How am I supposed to let you go?
Only like myself when I'm with you
Nobody gets me, you do (do)

Nobody gets me, you do (do)
You do
Nobody gets me, you do (do, ooh)

Wash your back while y'all sit in the shower, yeah
Someone to tell you, "You're beautiful"
Someone to tell you and mean it
Someone to tell you, "I love you" every day
And don't got a reason
You want someone to bring you peace, uh

Lift Me Up
Rihanna
Lift me up
Hold me down
Keep me close
Safe and sound
Burning in a hopeless dream
Hold me when you go to sleep
Keep me in the warmth of your love
When you depart, keep me safe
Safe and sound
Lift me up
Hold me down
Keep me close
Safe and sound
Drowning in an endless sea
Take some time and stay with me
Keep me in the strength of your arms
Keep me safe
Safe and sound
Lift me up
Hold me down
Keep me safe
Safe and sound
Burning in a hopeless dream
Hold me when you go to sleep
Keep me safe
We need light, we need love
lift me up in your arms
(Hold me down) I need love, I need love, I need love

What He Didnâ€™t Do
Carly Pearce
Everybody's asking what the hell happened
Wonderin' why it all went wrong
Mama always said, "If you can't say something nice
Then don't say anything at all"
And I've got my side of the story and he's got his side, too
So I ain't gonna go and tell you what he did
But I'll tell you what he didn't do
Treat me right, put me first, be a man of his word
Stay home 'cause he wanted to
Always fight for my love, hold on tight like it's something
That he couldn't stand to lose
The devil's in the details, I won't tell the hell that he put me through
All I know is in the end, it wasn't what he did
No, it was what he didn't do
I'm already halfway over him and I ain't taking time to turn around
So I'ma take the high road, even though we both know
I could run him out of this town
That's just dirty laundry, I don't need to wear the truth
So I ain't gonna tell you everything he did
But I'll tell you what he didn't do
Treat me right, put me first, be a man of his word
Stay home 'cause he wanted to
Always fight for my love, hold on tight like it's something
That he couldn't stand to lose
The devil's in the details, I won't tell the hell that he put me through
All I know is in the end, it wasn't what he did
No, it was what he didn't do
I ain't met the right one yet but I know when I do
He'll treat me right, put me first, be a man of his word
Stay home 'cause he wanted to
Always fight for my love, hold on tight like it's something
That he can't stand to lose
The devil's in the details, I won't tell the hell that he put me through
All I know is in the end, it wasn't what he did
No, it was what he didn't do
And all I know is in the end, it wasn't what he did
No, it was what he didn't do




Love Again
The Kid LAROI
I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought I'd hear my heartbeat so loud
I can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
I used to think that I was made out of stone
I used to spend so many nights on my own
I never knew I had it in me to dance anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
Again
So many nights, my tears fell harder than rain
Scared I would take my broken heart to the grave
I'd rather die than have to live in a storm like before
But goddamn, you got me in love again
Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love, and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
Again
I can't believe, I can't believe
I finally found someone
I'll sink my teeth in disbelief
'Cause you're the one that I want
I can't believe, I can't believe
I'm not afraid anymore
Goddamn, you got me in love again
La-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la
I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought I'd hear my heartbeat so loud
I can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore
Oh, goddamn, you got me in love again
I can't believe, I can't believe
I finally found someone
I'll sink my teeth in disbelief
'Cause you're the one that I want
I can't believe there's something left inside my chest anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again (again and again)
Again (and again and again and again)


Special
Lizzo Featuring SZA
Special
Woke up this mornin' to somebody judgin' me
No surprise they're judgin' me, don't know who I'm 'posed to be
I'm just actin' up, I'm rash as fuck, and never sayin' sorry
Found out it in the end that I can only do it for me
You call it sensitive and I call it superpower
You just lack empathy 'cause you think it gives you power
All I know is only God can judge me
I don't hide my heart, I wear it on me
I'm used to feeling alone, oh (feeling alone)
So, I thought that I'd let you know
In case nobody told you today
You're special
In case nobody made you believe (nobody, no, no)
You're special
Well, I will always love you the same
You're special
I'm so glad that you're still with us (so glad, so glad, so glad)
Broken, but damn, you're still perfect (you're perfect)
Special (ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba)
(Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba)
Could you imagine a world where everybody's the same?
And you could cancel a girl 'cause she just wanted to change?
How could you throw fucking stones if you ain't been through her pain?
That's why we feel so alone, that's why we feel so much shame, hmm
I'm used to feeling alone, oh
So, I thought that I'd let you know (oh)
In case nobody told you today
(I wait around for you)
You're special
In case nobody made you believe (nobody made you believe)
You're special
Well, I will always love you the same (I'll always love you)
You're special
I'm so glad that you're still with us
Broken, but damn, you're still perfect (perfect)
I know that I'm not alone, oh (no, you're not alone)
So, I thought that I'd let you know
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (woo)
In case nobody told you today (nobody told you, nobody)
You're special (yeah)
In case nobody made you believe (oh-oh)
You're special (yeah)
Well, I will always love you the same
(I'll always love you, I'll always love you)
You're special

But just like that R&B group from the '90s
Girl, one call, I'll get you in Vogue
One call, you in runway shows
One call, I'm sittin' front row
One wrong call from your ex nigga sayin' dumb shit'll get him sent home
One call and my niggas ten toes
Down to go wherever I say go
Even if we gotta travel 'cross the globe
Down to take you to the end of the road, for real
The way you make me feel these days
Somethin' gettin' dry for you, baby girl
Smoke a nigga top for you, baby girl
Burn somebody block for you
The way you make me feel these days
Comin' out my body for you, baby girl
Wipe him like he snotty for you, baby girl
Comin' out my body for you
Want ya, I want-want ya
Oh, your lovin' so deep (feelin' so deep)
Want ya, I want-want ya
Give me your lovin' (feelin' so deep)




Handle On You
Parker McCollum
I went and bought the biggest bottle they got 'cause you're gone
Drop the needle on a vinyl and cry to an old Haggard song
Sittin' at the table, baby, breaking the seal
Gonna see how much of this pain I can kill
I went and bought the biggest bottle they got 'cause you're gone
Tennessee and Kentucky 'cause you ain't here to love me
I drink now that there's nothing to lose
I've been fightin' with your memory, I hate the way it hits me
I wake up every day, black and blue
After all this back and forth, a fifth won't do
Yeah, I finally got a handle, finally got a handle on you
I tell myself that I should quit but I don't listen to drunks
I keep on sippin' 'til, "I miss you" don't roll off my tongue
Since you poured our love down the sink
I think I'll just stay here and drink
I tell myself that I should quit but I don't listen to drunks
Tennessee and Kentucky 'cause you ain't here to love me
I drink now that there's nothing to lose
I've been fightin' with your memory, I hate the way it hits me
I wake up every day, black and blue
After all this back and forth, a fifth won't do
Well, I finally got a handle on you
After all this back and forth, a fifth won't do
Yeah, I finally got a handle, finally got a handle on you
Handle on you
Yeah, I finally got a handle on you


Wild As Her
Corey Kent
She never wanted to be white picket fenced in
Her heart's like a feather in a Tulsa wind
Seaside breeze'll bring her to life
And all them other boys say she's a goodbye girl
She'll wreck your world
And leave before the mornin' sun
But here she is, free, layin' next to me
'Cause I ain't tryna to tame her love
I keep the windows down and the wind in her hair
Keep her heart hangin' on 'round every turn
She ain't scared to get tied down, scared to get burned
Just looking for somebody as wild as her
Wild, wild
Saw that highway unwind in her deep brown eyes
She saw a long stretch of dirt road dreamin' in mine
She ain't living for a diamond ring
Just living like the rock'n'roll song she sings out loud
We're burnin' it down
Blazin' up a trail of smoke
Wherever we are, wherever we go
Yeah, that's where she calls home
I keep the windows down and the wind in her hair
Keep her heart hangin' on 'round every turn
She ain't scared to get tied down, scared to get burned
Just looking for somebody as wild as her
Wild, wild
Yeah, man
Yeah, I ain't tryna fix her
I just wanna kiss her
Fuel a little fire in her soul
But we don't say forever, but when we're together
Swear that we ain't ever lettin' go
'Cause she knows
I keep the windows down and the wind in her hair
Keep her heart hanging on 'round every turn
She ain't scared to get tied down, scared to get burned
Just looking for somebody as wild as her
Wild, wild
Yeah




One Thing At A Time
Morgan Wallen
Somebody hand me a cigarette
I know I ain't had one in over a week
Somebody pour me a double shot
Been gettin' better by the day, but tonight I drink
You say I gotta get over you and get sober too
I got a lot of habits I gotta kick
Weigh out all your options and take your pick
I can either burn the bar down
Or I can take your number out my phone
I can give you up right now
And never want you back long as I'm half-stoned
If you want me to quit you, want me to get you
Outta my heart and, baby, off my mind
I hate to tell you, girl, but I'm only quittin' one thing at a time
I know I got me some problems
About a thousand memories I gotta forget
But if I'm gonna solve them
Baby, I'll take all the help I can get
If you ain't gonna kiss me
Then I'll take some whiskey, some Grizzly
Nicotine, amphetamines too
You want me to stop some of that
Or you want me to stop loving you?
Hey, what you want me to do?
I can either burn the bar down
Or I can take your number out my phone
I can give you up right now
And never want you back long as I'm half-stoned
If you want me to quit you, want me to get you
Outta my heart and, baby, off my mind
I hate to tell you, girl, but I'm only quittin' one thing at a time
Aw yeah, I hate to tell you
Aw yeah, I hate to tell you
I ain't no Superman, I'm just the way I am
If I'm gonna move on, then I need me something in my hand
Ain't nothing wrong with that
And if you ain't comin' back
I can either burn the bar down
Or I can take your number out my phone
I can give you up right now
And never want you back long as I'm half-stoned
If you want me to quit you, want me to get you
Outta my heart and, baby, off my mind
I hate to tell you, girl, but I'm only quittin' one thing at a time
Aw yeah, I hate to tell you
Aw yeah, I hate to tell you
Aw yeah, I hate to tell you




I Wrote The Book
Morgan Wallen
When it comes to
Hitchin' the boat up
Backin' down the ramp
In my old truck
To find a bunch of logs
To catch a bunch of hogs
Yeah, I wrote the book
Yeah, I wrote the book
If you wanna learn
To throw a curve right
To catch a clean up
Lookin' on a third strike
Talk a little smack
While he's walkin' back
Yeah, I wrote the book
But there's one that lays by the lamp on the nightstand
One that says don't cuss and don't fight
Or let the bottle turn you into a different man
But, damn, if I don't do it every Friday night
Those get you into Heaven letters in red
Ain't gettin' read enough to keep me on a straight line
I'm a Jack of all trades
But man I gotta say
That's one book I didn't write
I met a good girl
She had her life straight
She said she loved that I was good at everythin'
One day she left me in a cloud of dust
'Cause I never was too good at pickin' up
The one that lays by the lamp on the nightstand
One that says don't cuss and don't fight
Or let the bottle turn you into a different man
But, damn, if I don't do it every Friday night
Those get you into Heaven letters in red
Ain't gettin' read enough to keep me on a straight line
I'm a jack of all trades
But man I gotta say
That's one book I didn't write
Yeah the good Lord knows I need it
I didn't write it but I probably oughta read it
The one that lays by the lamp on the nightstand
One that says don't cuss and don't fight
Or let the bottle turn you into a different man
But, damn, if I don't do it every Friday night
Those get you into Heaven letters in red
Ain't gettin' read enough to keep me on a straight line
I'm a jack of all trades
But man I gotta say
That's one book I didn't write
That's one book I didn't write
That's one book I didn't write

Tennesse Orange
Megan Moroney
Mama, I'm callin', I've got some news
Don't ya tell daddy, he'll blow a fuse
Don't worry, I'm doin' okay
I know you raised me to know right from wrong
It ain't what you think and I'm still writin' songs
Just never thought I'd see the day
I've never felt this way
I met somebody and he's got blue eyes
He opens the door and he don't make me cry
He ain't from where we're from
But he feels like home, yeah
He's got me doin' things I've never done
In Georgia, they call it a sin
I'm wearing Tennessee orange for him
Took me to Knoxville last Saturday
And I wore the hat on his dash to the game
It sure wasn't Athens but I
Fell for him under those Neyland lights
I met somebody and he's got blue eyes
He opens the door and he don't make me cry
He ain't from where we're from
But he feels like home, yeah
He's got me doin' things I've never done
In Georgia they call it a sin
I'm wearing Tennessee orange for him
Mama, forgive me, I like him a lot
Hell, I'm learning the words to Old Rocky Top
And he's got a smile that makes me forget
I've always looked better in red
But I met somebody and he's got blue eyes
He opens the door and he don't make me cry
He ain't from where we're from
But he feels like home, yeah
He's got me doin' things I've never done
I met somebody and he's got blue eyes
He opens the door and he don't make me cry
He ain't from where we're from

In Georgia, they call it a sin
And I still want the Dawgs to win
But I'm wearing Tennessee orange for him

Gettin' fed up, you runnin' out of patience
Just keep your head up, I told you we would make it
Can't give my meds up, I see too many faces, uh
In them foreigns racin'
Best make it count, make sure it's no time wasted
I beat the trenches for my team, that was a great win
Lose when you gave it everything, that's hard to take in (uh-uh-uh)

You Didnâ€™t
Brett Young
I could never hate you even if I tried
Girl, I love you too much and I've loved you too long to fight
Mm
It ain't always a bad thing saying goodbye
And the last thing that I wanna be is a waste of your time
There's nothing I could say
To make you wanna stay
Your heart made up it's mind
I don't want you to lie one more minute
You ain't done nothing wrong
I'm not where you belong
Don't let one teardrop fall
Girl, you think it's your fault
But it isn't
I fell in love and you didn't
I hope you find someone
To be the person for you
Mm
That you were to me, what I wanted to be for you
I, I ain't ever asked you to settle or compromise
Girl, you deserve everything in this world
Even if it means you can't be mine
There's nothing I could say
To make you wanna stay
Your heart made up it's mind
I don't want you to lie one more minute
You ain't done nothing wrong
I'm not where you belong
Don't let one teardrop fall
Girl, you think it's your fault
But it isn't
I fell in love and you didn't
I fell in love and you didn't
Feel like I did
I gave you everything I had to give
You didn't need more
You just needed different
And there's nothing I could say
To make you wanna stay
Your heart made up it's mind
I don't want you to lie one more minute
You ain't done nothing wrong
I'm not where you belong
Don't let one teardrop fall
Girl, you think it's your fault
But it isn't
I fell in love and you didn't
I fell in love and you didn't




Nonsense
Sabrina Carpenter
No
(La-la, la-la) da-ah-ah, ah
(Ah-ah, uh, uh, uh, yeah)
Think I only want one number in my phone
I might change your contact to "don't leave me alone"
You said you like my eyes and you like to make 'em roll
Treat me like a queen, now you got me feelin' thrown, oh
But I can't help myself
When you get close to me
Baby, my tongue goes numb
Sounds like bleh, blah, blee
I don't want no one else (don't want)
Baby, I'm in too deep
Here's a lil' song I wrote (a song I wrote)
It's about you and me (me)
I'll be honest
Lookin' at you got me thinkin' nonsense
Cartwheels in my stomach when you walk in
And when you got your arms around me
Ooh, it feels so good I had to jump the octave
I think I got an ex but I forgot him
And I can't find my chill, I must have lost it
I don't even know I'm talkin' nonsense
I'm talkin', I'm talkin' (ah)
I'm talkin' all around clock
I'm talkin' hope nobody knocks
I'm talkin' opposite of soft
I'm talkin' wild, wild thoughts
You gotta keep up with me
I got some young energy
I caught the L-O-V-E
How do you do this to me?
But I can't help myself
When you get close to me
Baby, my tongue goes numb
Sounds like blah, blah, bleh, blee
I don't want no one else (don't want)
Baby, I'm in too deep (too deep)
Here's a lil' song I wrote (a song I wrote)
It's about you and me
I'll be honest (honest)
Lookin' at you got me thinkin' nonsense
Cartwheels in my stomach when you walk in (when you walk in)
When you got your arms around me
Ooh, it feels so good I had to hit the octave
I think I got an ex but I forgot him
And I can't find my chill, I must have lost it
I don't even know I'm talkin' nonsense (oh)
I'm talkin', I'm talkin', I'm talkin'
I'm talkin', I'm talkin'
Blah, blah, blah, blah, uh-uh-uh-uh
Ah
I don't even know anymore
(Oh)
This song catchier than chickenpox is
I bet your house is where my other sock is
Woke up this morning, thought I'd write a pop hit
How quickly can you take your clothes off pop quiz?
That one's not gonna make it
Most of these aren't gonna make



10:35
Tiesto Featuring Tate McRae
All I know it's 10:35
And I can feel your arms around me
Let 'em drown me
All I know it's 10:35
And I'm thanking, thanking God you found me
That you found me
Everyday, I go places in my head
Darker thoughts are harder now
They look like monsters under my bed
And every time, it's like a rocket through my chest
The TV make you think the whole world's about to end
I don't know where this night is goin' (goin')
But I know that you and me got somethin' (somethin')
So many things that I'm afraid of (afraid of)
But right now I ain't scared of nothin'
('Cause all I know is)
(All I know is, all I, all I)
'Cause all I know it's 10:35
And I can feel your arms around me
Let 'em drown me
All I know it's 10:35
And I'm thanking, thanking God you found me
That you found me
So don't you worry
About tomorrow
Don't you worry
Just pass the bottle
All I know it's 10:35
And I can feel your arms around me
Let 'em drown me
Every night, I go places in my dreams
So many never-ending alleyways
I don't know what it means
But this is it
I know the sun will wake me up
Tell me I'd be dumb to not get what I want
I don't know where this night is goin' (goin')
But I know that you and me got somethin'
So many things that I'm afraid of
But right now I ain't scared of nothin'
('Cause all I know is)
(All I know is, all I-, all I-)
'Cause all I know it's 10:35
And I can feel your arms around me
Let 'em drown me
All I know it's 10:35
And I'm thanking, thanking God you found me
That you found me
So don't you worry
About tomorrow
Don't you worry
Just pass the bottle
All I know it's 10:35
And I can feel your arms around me
Let 'em drown me (uh-oh, oh)
It's 10:35 (ooh-oh)
10:35 (uh-oh, oh)
Know it's 10:35 (uh-oh, oh)
Know it's 10:35 (uh-oh, oh)





Lost
Linkin Park
Just a scar somewhere down inside of me
Something I can not repair
Even though it will always be
I pretend it isn't there (this is how I feel)
I'm trapped in yesterday (just stay out of my way)
Where the pain is all I know (this is all I know)
And I'll never break away (can't break free)
'Cause when I'm alone
I'm lost in these memories
Living behind my own illusion
Lost all my dignity
Living inside my own confusion
But I'm tired, I will always be afraid
Of the damage I've received
Broken promises they made
And how blindly I believed (this is all I know)
I will never break away (can't break free)
'Cause when I'm alone
I'm lost in these memories
Living behind my own illusion
Lost all my dignity
Living inside my own confusion
I try to keep this pain inside but I will never be alright
I try to keep this pain inside but I will never be alright
(I'm lost) I try to keep this pain inside but I will never be alright
(I'm lost) I try to keep this pain inside but I will never be alright
I'm lost in these memories
Living behind my own illusion
Lost all my dignity
Living inside my own confusion


Ceilings
Lizzy McAlpine
Ceilings, plaster
Can't you just make it move faster?
Lovely to be sitting here with you
You're kinda cute but it's raining harder
My shoes are now full of water
Lovely to be rained on with you
It's kinda cute but it's so short
Then you're drivin' me home
And I don't wanna leave
But I have to go
You kiss me in your car
And it feels like the start of a movie I've seen before
Before
Bedsheets, no clothes
Touch me like nobody else does
Lovely to just lay here with you
You're kinda cute and I would say all of this
But I don't wanna ruin the moment
Lovely to sit between comfort and chaos
But it's over
Then you're drivin' me home
And it kinda comes out as I get up to go
You kiss me in your car
And it feels like the start of a movie I've seen before
But it's not real
And you don't exist
And I can't recall the last time I was kissed
It hits me in the car
And it feels like the end of a movie I've seen before
Before




Trance
Metro Boomin, Travis Scott & Young Thug
Did you forget?

We pulled out the feathers for this type of weather
She pulled to club, to buss up a dub
She came with her man, I called in a sub

I bent the corner scraped the wheels and the tires
Put twenty hoes on a boat til they tired
Everybody on
You now you need me my nigga, just keep the shit real
Don't you crab with your song
Who else fuck up the city like us?
When it rains, it's a thunderstorm
I party at Shabba, in New York and LA
Where they keep on going till the dawn (shabba)

She licking all down my chest
I told her I aint slime bae call me sex
It ain't no dope where I put these racks at

I've been... inside
I've been inside
I've been just like
It's this life
It's this life
It's this life


Thatâ€™s What Tequila Does
Jason Aldean
It don't take too much
To get the wheels turning 'round and 'round in my head
Top shelf or Cuervo
I know it's gonna stir up every memory she left
Still burns, I can't lie
When I think about the good before goodbye
Guess that's what I'm drinking on tonight
It'll make you think that
You got a shot at the one that got away when it goes down
She's gonna tell you, she's gonna come back
And that's what makes you stay for another round
Keep you stickin' around, keep pourin' out
Until she's all you're thinkin' 'bout
It'll keep you hung up, keep you drunk on what it was
Man, that's what tequila does
It sneaks up on you
Going out for one turns into 2 AM
You know what's next, get you looking for a text
Get you checking your phone again
Make you stay all night, it'll give you a million reasons why
It'll make you think that
You got a shot at the one that got away when it goes down
She's gonna tell you, she's gonna come back
And that's what makes you stay for another round
Keep you stickin' around, keep pourin' out
Until she's all you're thinkin' 'bout
It'll keep you hung up, keep you drunk on what it was
Man, that's what tequila does
Whoa
Yeah, that's what tequila does
Whoa
It still burns (still burns), I can't lie (I can't lie)
Oh, guess that's what I'm drinking on tonight (whoa)
It'll make you think that
You got a shot at the one that got away when it goes down
She's gonna tell you, she's gonna come back
And that's what makes you stay for another round
Keep you stickin' around, keep pourin' out
Until she's all you're thinkin' 'bout
It'll keep you hung up, keep you drunk on what it was
Man, that's what tequila does
Whoa
Yeah, that's what tequila does
Whoa



Here With Me
D4vd
Can I tell you something just between you and me?
When I hear your voice, I know I'm finally free
Every single word is perfect as it can be
And I need you here with me
When you lift me up, I know that I'll never fall
I can speak to you by saying nothing at all
Every single time, I find it harder to breathe
'Cause I need you here with me
Every day
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me
Every day
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me
I think I see your face in every place that I go
I try to hide it, but I know that it's gonna show
Every single night, I find it harder to sleep
'Cause I need you here with me
Everyday
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me
Every day
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me
Can I tell you something just between you and me?
When I hear your voice, I know I'm finally free
Every single word is perfect as it can be
'Cause I need you here with me

Everything I Love 
Morgan Wallen
I wish I woulda met you anywhere but where I did
Some ol' high rise town that I won't ever go again
Wish we woulda rolled around in some old cab and chased them city lights
And hit bars I don't like
We were listenin' to One More Silver Dollar
Hanging out my Silverado
Down a road I love to ride
Wish I woulda known that by now, you'd be good and gone
And you'd leave us in a cloud of dust
And can't you see what you're doing, girl?
You ruined damn near everything I love
I don't care how much they're bitin'
I won't even crank the boat
Soon as that bobber hits the water
Girl, your memory starts to float
Baby, why'd I'd ever take the bait
And take you places that I love to go?
Hell, I'll never know
I even took you to my hometown to meet my mama
Now, I'm gonna see you every time I see that welcome sign
Wish I would've known that by now, you'd be good and gone
And you'd leave us in a cloud of dust
And can't you see what you're doing, girl?
You ruined damn near everything I love
I don't wanna hear One More Silver Dollar
I can't take my Silverado down them roads we used to ride
Wish I would've known that by now, you'd be good and gone
And you'd leave us in a cloud of dust
Can't you see what you're doing, girl?
You ruined damn near everything I love
I can't go nowhere near the whiskey
'Cause you used to drink it with me
In the bed of my truck
And now I can't get drunk
Can't you see what you're doing, girl?
You ruined damn near everything I love
Can't you see what you're doing, girl?
You ruined damn near everything I love


Forever
Lil Baby Featuring Fridayy
It may not mean nothing to y'all,
Understand nothing was done for me,
So i don't plan on stopping at all,
I want this sh-t forever man, ever man, ever man,
I'm shutting sh-t down in the mall,
And telling every girl she the one for me,
And i aint even planning to call,
I want this sh-t forever man, ever man, ever man
Last name ever,
First name greatest,
Like a sprained ankle boy I ain't nuttin to play with,
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters,
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis,
And your city faded off the brown, Nino,
She insists she got more class, we know!
Swimming in the money come and find me, Nemo,
If i was at the club you know I ball'd, chemo,
Drop the mixtape that sh-t sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a country wide tour would be the outcome
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one,
Yeah n-gga i'm about my business,
Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list,
Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness,
If you aint been a part of it at least you got to witness,
B-tches,
It may not mean nothing to y'all,
Understand nothing was done for me,
So i don't plan on stopping at all,
I want this sh-t forever man, ever man, ever man,
I'm shutting sh-t down in the mall,
And telling every girl she the one for me,
And i aint even planning to call,
I want this sh-t forever man, ever man, ever man
Ever ever, Mr West is in the Building,
Aint no question who about to kill em,
I used to have hood dreams,
Big fame, big chains,
I stuck my d-ck inside this life until that b-tch came,
I went hard all Fall like the ball teams,
Just so I can make it rain all spring,
Y'all seen my story my glory,
I had raped the game young,
You can call it statutory,
When a n-gga blow up they gon build statues of me
Old money Benjamin Button, whaat, nuttin,
Now superbad chicks giving me McLovin,
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband,
You would think these n-ggas would know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you f-cking wasn't,
Your'e such a f-cking loser,
He didn't even go to class Bueller,
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back,
Lyrics courtesy of killerhiphop.com
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack,
Chasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac,
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act,
They pull their cameras out and God damn he snapped,
I used to want this thing forever y'all can have it back,
It may not mean nothing to y'all,
Understand nothing was done for me,
So i don't plan on stopping at all,
I want this sh-t forever man, ever man, ever man,
I'm shutting sh-t down in the mall,
And telling every girl she the one for me,
And i aint even planning to call,
I want this sh-t forever man, ever man, ever man
Ok, hello its da martian,
Space jam Jordan's,
I want this sh-t forever wake up and smell the Garden,
Fresher than the harvest
Step up to the target,
If i had one guess than I guess im just New Orleans,
And I will never stop like i'm running from the cops,
Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur "to the top",
Life is such a f-cking roller coaster then it drops,
But what should I scream for this is my theme park,
My minds shine even when my thoughts seem dark,
Pistol on my side you don't wanna hear that thing talk,
Let the King talk, check the price and pay attention,
Lil Wayne thats what they got to say or mention,
Lyrics courtesy of killerhiphop.com
Im like Nevada in the middle of the summer,
I'm resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover,
Ssshhh, my foots sleeping on the gas,
No brake pads no such thing as last- huh,
It may not mean nothing to y'all,
Understand nothing was done for me,
So i don't plan on stopping at all,
I want this sh-t forever man, ever man, ever man,
I'm shutting sh-t down in the mall,
And telling every girl she the one for me,
And i aint even planning to call,
I want this sh-t forever man, ever man, ever man
There they go, packin' stadiums
As Shady spits his flow,
Nuts they go, macadamian they go so ballistic whoa,
We can make them look like bozo's,
He's wondering if he should spit this slow,
F-ck no go for broke,
His cup just runneth over oh no
He aint had a buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed,
They've been waiting patiently for Pinnochio to poke his nose,
Back into the game and they know,
Rap will never be the same as before,
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes,
And establishing a name as he goes,
The passion and the flame is ignited,
You can't put it out once we light it,
This sh-t is exactly what the f-ck that i'm talking about when we riot,
You dealin with a few true villians
Who stand inside of the booth truth spillin,
Lyrics courtesy of killerhiphop.com
And spit true feelings, until our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths
Now rewind it
Payback muthaf-cka for the way that you doubted me so how's it taste?
When I slap the taste out your mouth with the bass so loud that it shakes the place,
I'm hannibal lecter so just in case your thinking of saving face,
You aint gonna have no face to save by the time Im through with this place,
So Drake...
It may not mean nothing to y'all,
Understand nothing was done for me,
So i don't plan on stopping at all,
I want this sh-t forever man, ever man, ever man,
I'm shutting sh-t down in the mall,
And telling every girl she the one for me,
And i aint even planning to call,
I want this sh-t forever man, ever man, ever man

The Color Violet
Tory Lanez
I took my drugs and took my lovin' when I left out the spot
I left the party with a Barbie, markin' X on the dot
She calls my phone up but I told her, "I'm a loner" (uh)
But she likes my watch and my droptop and my persona (uh)
We hit the highway, 1-5-5, with my whole foot on the dash
She's in my ear, she's got no fear, she could care less if we crash
But on my radar, I've got some nerve to play hard
I've waited for my chance, but playboys we don't dance, dance, dance
I gave my heart (uh)
Speedin' car goin' ninety in the rain
She took my heart, filled it with nothin' but pain
This beat in my hands is not for romance
I wanna stay but, playboys, we don't dance, dance, dance
So I won't dance again, oh, baby
No, I won't dance again, ooh, yeah (uh)
No, I won't dance again
No, I won't dance again
Pretty baby, ooh
Oh, face in the daylight, wastin' time on the stars in the sky
She's got my pager, play games of love all on my eyes
Then I'm reminded, love don't come 'til you find it
I just hope that it's workin', I'm yearnin', I'm searchin', uh
The afterparty was on Wilson and 73rd
You got the notion that somebody else was with me first
But on my radar, you had some nerve to play hard
You took away my chance, but playboys we don't dance, dance, dance
I gave my heart (uh)
Speedin' car goin' ninety in the rain
She took my heart, filled it with nothin' but pain
This beat in my hands is not for romance
I wanna stay but, playboys, we don't dance, dance, dance
So I won't dance again, oh, baby
No, I won't dance again, ooh, yeah (uh)
No, I won't dance again
No, I won't dance again
Pretty baby, ooh


Human
Cody Johnson
I'm only human
I'm only, I'm only
I'm only human, human
Maybe I'm foolish
Maybe I'm blind
Thinking I can see through this
And see what's behind
Got no way to prove it
So maybe I'm blind
But I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put your blame on me
Don't put your blame on me
Take a look in the mirror
And what do you see
Do you see it clearer
Or are you deceived
In what you believe
'Cause I'm only human after all
You're only human after all
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put your blame on me
Some people got the real problems
Some people out of luck
Some people think I can solve them
Lord heavens above
I'm only human after all

Blind
SZA
Niggas want me to get ratchet
Niggas want me to attack it
Put the hood on, now they callin' me Cassius
Raunchy like Bob Saget
Greedy, I can't pass it
Eatin' everything, nigga, no fasting
I don't care how much you knew me in the past tense
I ain't no Julia Stiles, this ain't no last dance, way past it
Way
Fuckin' on my ex 'cause he validate me
Fuckin' up a check, I don't want no receipt
Might get possessed, let my spirit speak freely
Hey, my past can't escape me
My pussy precedes me
My, my, how the times change
I'm still playin' the victim
And you still playin' the pick-me
It's so embarrassing
All of the things I need living inside of me
I can't see it
It's so embarrassing
All of the love I seek living inside of me
I can't see, I'm blind
Blind, blind
Blind, blind
Blind, blind
Blind, blind
Blind, blind
You ain't getting your bitch back
Calm down, shit could be worse, never say that
I don't wanna pipe down, rather get payback
Mama told me, "Never shit where you lay at"
I don't want righteousness
I hurt too much, I lost too much, I lust too much
I hit my clutch and vroom
Third day, pop out the tomb
I like when you pull your gun at the red light
I like all that violence, give me dysfunction
I like when you come, never stay the whole night
Better when you high, never tell me I'm wrong
'Cause my past can't escape me
My pussy precedes me
My, my, how the times change
You still talkin' 'bout babies
And I'm still taking the Plan B
It's so embarrassing
All of the things I need living inside of me
I can't see it
It's so embarrassing
All of the love I seek living inside of me
I can't see, I'm blind
Blind, blind
Blind, blind
Blind, blind
Blind, blind
Blind, blind




Trustfall
P!nk
Picture a place where it all doesn't hurt
Where everything's safe and it doesn't get worse
Oh my
We see through bloodshot eyes
Picture a place, somewhere else far away
Where you know what they mean and they mean what they say
To us
And would that be enough?
Are we runnin' out of time?
Are we hidin' from the light?
Are we just too scared to fight
For what we want tonight?
Close your eyes and leave it all behind
Go where love is on our side
It's a trust fall, baby
It's a trust fall, baby
You and I and everyone, alive
We can run into the fire
It's a trust fall, baby
Yeah, it's a trust fall, baby
Jump with me, come with me, burn like the sun
We'll talk, then we'll cry, then we'll laugh 'til we're done
Oh my
It's like we're out our minds
We've been runnin' for our lives
We've been hidin' from the light
We've been far too scared to fight
For what we want tonight
Close your eyes and leave it all behind
Go where love is on our side
It's a trust fall, baby
It's a trust fall, baby
You and I and everyone, alive
We can run into the fire
It's a trust fall, baby
Yeah, it's a trust fall, baby
What if we just fall?
I'm not goin' without you
(And you're not goin' alone)
I fell so far 'til I found you
(But you know what you know, when you know)
So I'm not goin' without you
(And you're not goin' alone)
'Cause you know when you know
Close your eyes and leave it all behind
Go where love is on our side
It's a trust fall, baby
It's a trust fall, baby
What if we just fall?
What if we just fall?
What if we just fall?
What if we just fall?
What if we just fall?
What if we just fall?

Shut Up My Moms Calling
Hotel Ugly
I just wanna rewind
I haven't seen you in a long time
You got me feelin' so lonely
Even when you come through
I can tell that it isn't you
So baby, bring it in closely
Hate the way I love you, but you're so sweet
I always find a way to say the wrong things
I wish that we were layin' in the same sheets
But lately, you've been actin' like you hardly know me
Baby, come home
(So baby, won't you say somethin'?)
Home
Baby, come home
(So baby, won't you say somethin'?)

You got me feelin' so lonely
Even when you come through
I can tell that it isn't you
So baby, bring it in closely
Hate the way I love you, but you're so sweet
I always find a way to say the wrong things
I wish that we were layin' in the same sheets
But lately, you've been actin' like you hardly know me
I've only recently began to fall
I feel the need to go and waste it all
I tried to numb away the pain
I hope someone is watchin' me, watchin' me, watchin' me
Baby, come home
(So baby, won't you say somethin'?)

Thank you for comin' home
Sorry that the chairs are all worn
I left them here, I could have sworn
These are my salad days
Slowly being eaten away
Just another play for today
Oh, but I'm proud of you, but I'm proud of you
Nothing left to make me feel small
Luck has left me standing so tall
Gold
Always believe in your soul
You've got the power to know
You're indestructible
Always believe in
'Cause you are gold
I'm glad that you're bound to return
Something I could have learned
You're indestructible
Always believe in
After the rush has gone
I hope you find a little more time
Remember we were partners in crime
It's only two years ago
The man with the suit and the face
You knew that he was there on the case
Now he's in love with you, he's in love with you
Love is like a high prison wall
But you don't leave me standing so tall
Gold
Always believe in your soul
You've got the power to know
You're indestructible
Always believe in, 'cause you are
Gold
I'm glad that you're bound to return
There's something I could have learned
You're indestructible
Always believe in
And love is like a high prison wall
And you could leave me standing so tall

You've got the power to know
You're indestructible
