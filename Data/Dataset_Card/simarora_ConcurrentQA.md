ConcurrentQA is a textual multi-hop QA benchmark to require concurrent retrieval over multiple data-distributions (i.e. Wikipedia and email data). It follows the data collection process and schema of HotpotQA. 

The data set is downloadable here: https://github.com/facebookresearch/concurrentqa. It also contains model and result analysis code. This benchmark can also be used to study privacy when reasoning over data distributed in multiple privacy scopes --- i.e. Wikipedia in the public domain and emails in the private domain.
