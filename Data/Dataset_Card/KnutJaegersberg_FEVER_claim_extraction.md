I found this dataset on my harddrive, which if I remember correctly I got from the source mentioned in the paper: 
"Claim extraction from text using transfer learning" - By Acharya Ashish Prabhakar, Salar Mohtaj, Sebastian MÃ¶ller

https://aclanthology.org/2020.icon-main.39/

The github repo with the data seems down. 
It extends FEVER dataset with non-claims for training claim detectors.
