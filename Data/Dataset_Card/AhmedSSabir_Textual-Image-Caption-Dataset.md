# Introduction

Modern image captaining relies heavily on extracting knowledge, from images such as objects,
to capture the concept of static story in the image. In this paper, we propose a textual visual context dataset 
for captioning, where the publicly available dataset COCO caption (Lin et al., 2014) has been extended with information 
about the scene (such as objects in the image). Since this information has textual form, it can be used to leverage any NLP task,
such as text similarity or semantic relation methods, into captioning systems, either as an end-to-end training strategy or a post-processing based approach.

# Overview

 We enrich COCO-Caption with textual Visual Context information. We use ResNet152, CLIP, 
          and Faster R-CNN to extract object information for each  image. We use three filter approaches 
          to ensure the quality of the dataset (1) Threshold: to filter out predictions where the object classifier 
          is not confident enough,  and (2) semantic alignment with semantic similarity to remove duplicated objects. 
          (3) semantic relatedness score as soft-label: to guarantee the visual context and caption have a strong 
          relation. In particular, we use Sentence-RoBERTa via cosine similarity to give a soft score, and then 
          we use a threshold to annotate the final label (if th â‰¥ 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 then 1,0). Finally, to take advantage 
          of the visual overlap  between caption and visual context, and to extract global information, we use BERT followed by a shallow CNN (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5882">Kim, 2014</a>)
          to estimate the visual relatedness score.
