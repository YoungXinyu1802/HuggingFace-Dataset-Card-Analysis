## Auto Miles per Gallon (MPG) Dataset

Following description was taken from [UCI machine learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/auto+mpg).
Source: This dataset was taken from the StatLib library which is maintained at Carnegie Mellon University. The dataset was used in the 1983 American Statistical Association Exposition.

## Data Set Information:

This dataset is a slightly modified version of the dataset provided in the StatLib library. In line with the use by Ross Quinlan (1993) in predicting the attribute "mpg", 8 of the original instances were removed because they had unknown values for the "mpg" attribute. The original dataset is available in the file "auto-mpg.data-original".

"The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon, to be predicted in terms of 3 multivalued discrete and 5 continuous attributes." (Quinlan, 1993)


## Attribute Information:

- cylinders: multi-valued discrete
- displacement: continuous
- horsepower: continuous
