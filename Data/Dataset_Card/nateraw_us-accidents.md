### Dataset Summary

### Description
This is a countrywide car accident dataset, which covers __49 states of the USA__. The accident data are collected from __February 2016 to Dec 2021__, using multiple APIs that provide streaming traffic incident (or event) data. These APIs broadcast traffic data captured by a variety of entities, such as the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road-networks. Currently, there are about __2.8 million__ accident records in this dataset. Check [here](https://smoosavi.org/datasets/us_accidents) to learn more about this dataset.

### Content
This dataset has been collected in real-time, using multiple Traffic APIs. Currently, it contains accident data that are collected from February 2016 to Dec 2021 for the Contiguous United States. Check [here](https://smoosavi.org/datasets/us_accidents) to learn more about this dataset. 

### Inspiration
US-Accidents can be used for numerous applications such as real-time car accident prediction, studying car accidents hotspot locations, casualty analysis and extracting cause and effect rules to predict car accidents, and studying the impact of precipitation or other environmental stimuli on accident occurrence. The most recent release of the dataset can also be useful to study the impact of COVID-19 on traffic behavior and accidents.
