### Dataset Summary

Dataset containing triplets (three sentences): anchor, positive, and negative. Contains titles of papers.

Disclaimer: The team releasing SPECTER did not upload the dataset to the Hub and did not write a dataset card. 
These steps were done by the Hugging Face team.

## Dataset Structure
Each example in the dataset contains triplets of equivalent sentences and is formatted as a dictionary with the key "set" and a list with the sentences as "value".

Each example is a dictionary with a key, "set", containing a list of three sentences (anchor, positive, and negative):

```
{"set": [anchor, positive, negative]}
{"set": [anchor, positive, negative]}
...
{"set": [anchor, positive, negative]}
```
This dataset is useful for training Sentence Transformers models. Refer to the following post on how to train models using triplets.

### Usage Example
Install the ðŸ¤— Datasets library with `pip install datasets` and load the dataset from the Hub with:
```python
from datasets import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset("embedding-data/SPECTER")
```
The dataset is loaded as a `DatasetDict` and has the format:
```python
DatasetDict({
    train: Dataset({
        features: ['set'],
        num_rows: 684100
    })
})
```
Review an example `i` with:
```python
dataset["train"][i]["set"]
```
