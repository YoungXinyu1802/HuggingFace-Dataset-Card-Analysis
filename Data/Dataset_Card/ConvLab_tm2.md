To use this dataset, you need to install [ConvLab-3](https://github.com/ConvLab/ConvLab-3) platform first. Then you can load the dataset via:
```
from convlab.util import load_dataset, load_ontology, load_database

dataset = load_dataset('tm2')
ontology = load_ontology('tm2')
database = load_database('tm2')
```
For more usage please refer to [here](https://github.com/ConvLab/ConvLab-3/tree/master/data/unified_datasets).

### Dataset Summary

The Taskmaster-2 dataset consists of 17,289 dialogs in the seven domains. Unlike Taskmaster-1, which includes both written "self-dialogs" and spoken two-person dialogs, Taskmaster-2 consists entirely of spoken two-person dialogs. In addition, while Taskmaster-1 is almost exclusively task-based, Taskmaster-2 contains a good number of search- and recommendation-oriented dialogs, as seen for example in the restaurants, flights, hotels, and movies verticals. The music browsing and sports conversations are almost exclusively search- and recommendation-based. All dialogs in this release were created using a Wizard of Oz (WOz) methodology in which crowdsourced workers played the role of a 'user' and trained call center operators played the role of the 'assistant'. In this way, users were led to believe they were interacting with an automated system that “spoke” using text-to-speech (TTS) even though it was in fact a human behind the scenes. As a result, users could express themselves however they chose in the context of an automated interface.

- **How to get the transformed data from original data:** 
  - Download [master.zip](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/Taskmaster/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).
  - Run `python preprocess.py` in the current directory.
- **Main changes of the transformation:**
  - Remove dialogs that are empty or only contain one speaker.
  - Split each domain dialogs into train/validation/test randomly (8:1:1).
  - Merge continuous turns by the same speaker (ignore repeated turns).
  - Annotate `dialogue acts` according to the original segment annotations. Add `intent` annotation (`==inform`). The type of `dialogue act` is set to `non-categorical` if the `slot` is not in `anno2slot` in `preprocess.py`). Otherwise, the type is set to `binary` (and the `value` is empty). If there are multiple spans overlapping, we only keep the shortest one, since we found that this simple strategy can reduce the noise in annotation.
  - Add `domain`, `intent`, and `slot` descriptions.
  - Add `state` by accumulate `non-categorical dialogue acts` in the order that they appear.
  - Keep the first annotation since each conversation was annotated by two workers.
- **Annotations:**
  - dialogue acts, state.
