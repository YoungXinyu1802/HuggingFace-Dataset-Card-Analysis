### Dataset Summary

Emotion is a dataset of English Twitter messages with six basic emotions: anger, fear, joy, love, sadness, and surprise. For more detailed information please refer to the paper.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

An example looks as follows.
```
{
  "text": "im feeling quite sad and sorry for myself but ill snap out of it soon",
  "label": 0
}
```

### Data Fields

The data fields are:
- `text`: a `string` feature.
- `label`: a classification label, with possible values including `sadness` (0), `joy` (1), `love` (2), `anger` (3), `fear` (4), `surprise` (5).

### Data Splits

The dataset has 2 configurations:
- split: with a total of 20_000 examples split into train, validation and split
- unsplit: with a total of 416_809 examples in a single train split

| name    |  train | validation | test |
|---------|-------:|-----------:|-----:|
| split   |  16000 |       2000 | 2000 |
| unsplit | 416809 |        n/a |  n/a |

    abstract = "Emotions are expressed in nuanced ways, which varies by collective or individual experiences, knowledge, and beliefs. Therefore, to understand emotion, as conveyed through text, a robust mechanism capable of capturing and modeling different linguistic nuances and phenomena is needed. We propose a semi-supervised, graph-based algorithm to produce rich structural descriptors which serve as the building blocks for constructing contextualized affect representations from text. The pattern-based representations are further enriched with word embeddings and evaluated through several emotion recognition tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on emotion recognition tasks.",
