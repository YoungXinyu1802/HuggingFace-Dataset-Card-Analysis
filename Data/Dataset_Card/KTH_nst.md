# NST Swedish ASR Database (16 kHz) â€“ reorganized

This database was created by Nordic Language Technology for the development of automatic speech recognition and dictation in Swedish. In this updated version, the organization of the data have been altered to improve the usefulness of the database.

In the original version of the material, the files were organized in a specific folder structure where the folder names were meaningful. However, the file names were not meaningful, and there were also cases of files with identical names in different folders. This proved to be impractical, since users had to keep the original folder structure in order to use the data. The files have been renamed, such that the file names are unique and meaningful regardless of the folder structure. The original metadata files were in spl format. These have been converted to JSON format. The converted metadata files are also anonymized and the text encoding has been converted from ANSI to UTF-8.

See the documentation file for a full description of the data and the changes made to the database.

The data is originally hosted on the National Library of Norway website.
