# Slyvanie Style Embedding / Textual Inversion

## Usage
To use this embedding you have to download the file, as well as drop it into the "\stable-diffusion-webui\embeddings" folder

To use it in a prompt: ```"art by slyvanie_style"```

If it is to strong just add [] around it.

This embedding was trained to 14500 steps.

If you'd like to support the amazing artist whose artwork contributed to this embedding's training, I'd highly recommend you check out slyvanie [here](https://www.deviantart.com/slyvanie), [here](https://www.artstation.com/slyvanie) and [here](https://slyvanie.weebly.com/).

Have fun :)
