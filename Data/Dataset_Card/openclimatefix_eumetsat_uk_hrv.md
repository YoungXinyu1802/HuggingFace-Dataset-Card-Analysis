### Dataset Summary

<p>The EUMETSAT Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) rapid scanning service (RSS) takes an image of the northern third of the Meteosat disc every five minutes (see <a href="https://www.eumetsat.int/rapid-scanning-service">the EUMETSAT website for more information on SEVIRI RSS</a>). The <a href="https://navigator.eumetsat.int/product/EO:EUM:DAT:MSG:MSG15-RSS">original EUMETSAT dataset</a> contains data from 2008 to the present day from 12 channels, and for a wide geographical extent covering North Africa, Saudi Arabia, all of Europe, and Western Russia. In contrast, this dataset on Google Cloud is a small subset of the entire SEVIRI RSS dataset: This Google Cloud dataset is from a single channel: the "high resolution visible" (HRV) channel; and contains data from January 2020 to November 2021. The geographical extent of this dataset on Google Cloud is a small subset of the total SEVIRI RSS extent: This Google Cloud dataset includes data over the United Kingdom and over North Western Europe.</p>

<p>This dataset is slightly transformed: It does not contain the original numerical values. See the "samples" section for more technical detail about the dataset.</p>

<p>The original data is copyright <a href="https://www.eumetsat.int">EUMETSAT</a>. EUMETSAT has given permission to redistribute this transformed data. The data was transformed by <a href="https://openclimatefix.org/">Open Climate Fix</a> using <a href="https://github.com/openclimatefix/Satip">satip</a>.</p>

### Curation Rationale

This dataset was originally created for helping improve national PV output forecasts in combination with Numerical Weather Predictions and other data sources.

### Source Data

#### Initial Data Collection and Normalization

Data generated by <a href="https://navigator.eumetsat.int/product/EO:EUM:DAT:MSG:MSG15-RSS">EUMETSAT Rapid Scan High Rate SEVIRI Level 1.5 Image Data MSG</a> with preparation by <a href="https://openclimatefix.org/">Open Climate Fix</a>

### Discussion of Biases

### Other Known Limitations

This dataset only includes the High Resolution Visible channel, and covers only the area around the UK. Additionally, the RSS service is shut down for 1 month each year, and so data for most of
February 2020 and 2021 does not exist.
