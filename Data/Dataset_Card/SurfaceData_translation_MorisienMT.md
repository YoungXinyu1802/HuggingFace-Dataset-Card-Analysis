MorisienMT is a dataset for Mauritian Creole Machine Translation.  This dataset
consists of training, development and test set splits for English--Creole as
well as French--Creole translation.  The data comes from a variety of sources
and hence can be considered as belonging to the general domain.

The training set for English--Creole contains 21,810 lines.

Finally, we also provide a Creole monolingual corpus of 45,364 lines.

Note that a significant portion of the dataset is a dictionary of word
pairs/triplets, nevertheless it is a start.

Feel free to use the dataset for your research but don't forget to attribute
our upcoming paper which will be uploaded to arxiv shortly.

NOTE: MorisienMT was originally partly developed by Dr Aneerav Sukhoo from the
University of Mauritius in 2014 when he was a visiting researcher in IIT
Bombay.  Dr Sukhoo and Raj Dabre worked on the MT experiments together, but
never publicly released the dataset back then.  Furthermore, the dataset splits
and experiments were not done in a highly principled manner, which is required
in the present day.  Therefore, we improve the quality of splits and officially
release the data for people to use.
