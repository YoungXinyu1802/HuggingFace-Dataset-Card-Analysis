Images trained for my [phantom diffusion s2](https://huggingface.co/Phantom-Artist/phantom-diffusion-s2) series.

Since they are all AI generated images that are public domain under the US law, I claim it is legal to redistribute them as public domain.

However, they might have copyright in your/their original country.

Still, many countries including Japan allow us to use them for training an AI under their copyrights law, and because all the artists here are from Japan, I assume it should be allowed to reuse it for training globally.
