## Dataset Description

- **Homepage:** [MultiLingual LibriSpeech ASR corpus](http://www.openslr.org/94)
- **Repository:** [Needs More Information]
- **Paper:** [MLS: A Large-Scale Multilingual Dataset for Speech Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03411)
- **Leaderboard:** [ðŸ¤— Autoevaluate Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/autoevaluate/leaderboards?dataset=facebook%2Fmultilingual_librispeech&only_verified=0&task=automatic-speech-recognition&config=-unspecified-&split=-unspecified-&metric=wer)

### Dataset Summary

This is a streamable version of the Multilingual LibriSpeech (MLS) dataset. 
The data archives were restructured from the original ones from [OpenSLR](http://www.openslr.org/94) to make it easier to stream.

MLS dataset is a large multilingual corpus suitable for speech research. The dataset is derived from read audiobooks from LibriVox and consists of 
8 languages - English, German, Dutch, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, Polish.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

- `automatic-speech-recognition`, `speaker-identification`: The dataset can be used to train a model for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). The model is presented with an audio file and asked to transcribe the audio file to written text. The most common evaluation metric is the word error rate (WER). The task has an active leaderboard which can be found at https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/multilingual-librispeech and ranks models based on their WER.

### Languages

The dataset is derived from read audiobooks from LibriVox and consists of 8 languages - English, German, Dutch, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, Polish

### How to use

The `datasets` library allows you to load and pre-process your dataset in pure Python, at scale. The dataset can be downloaded and prepared in one call to your local drive by using the `load_dataset` function. 

For example, to download the German config, simply specify the corresponding language config name (i.e., "german" for German):
```python
from datasets import load_dataset

mls = load_dataset("facebook/multilingual_librispeech", "german", split="train")
```

Using the datasets library, you can also stream the dataset on-the-fly by adding a `streaming=True` argument to the `load_dataset` function call. Loading a dataset in streaming mode loads individual samples of the dataset at a time, rather than downloading the entire dataset to disk.
```python
from datasets import load_dataset

mls = load_dataset("facebook/multilingual_librispeech", "german", split="train", streaming=True)

print(next(iter(mls)))
```

*Bonus*: create a [PyTorch dataloader](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/use_with_pytorch) directly with your own datasets (local/streamed).

Local:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
from torch.utils.data.sampler import BatchSampler, RandomSampler

mls = load_dataset("facebook/multilingual_librispeech", "german", split="train")
batch_sampler = BatchSampler(RandomSampler(mls), batch_size=32, drop_last=False)
dataloader = DataLoader(mls, batch_sampler=batch_sampler)
```

Streaming:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

mls = load_dataset("facebook/multilingual_librispeech", "german", split="train", streaming=True)
dataloader = DataLoader(mls, batch_size=32)
```

### Example scripts

Train your own CTC or Seq2Seq Automatic Speech Recognition models on MultiLingual Librispeech with `transformers` - [here](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/pytorch/speech-recognition).

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

A typical data point comprises the path to the audio file, usually called `file` and its transcription, called `text`. Some additional information about the speaker and the passage which contains the transcription is provided.

```
{'file': '10900_6473_000030.flac',
 'audio': {'path': '10900_6473_000030.flac',
  'array': array([-1.52587891e-04,  6.10351562e-05,  0.00000000e+00, ...,
          4.27246094e-04,  5.49316406e-04,  4.57763672e-04]),
  'sampling_rate': 16000},
 'text': 'wiÄ™c czego chcecie odemnie spytaÅ‚em wysÅ‚uchawszy tego zadziwiajÄ…cego opowiadania broÅ„ nas stary czÅ‚owieku broÅ„ zakrzyknÄ™li rÃ³wnoczeÅ›nie obaj posÅ‚owie\n',
 'speaker_id': 10900,
 'chapter_id': 6473,
 'id': '10900_6473_000030'}
```


### Data Fields

- file: A filename .flac format.

- audio: A dictionary containing the audio filename, the decoded audio array, and the sampling rate. Note that when accessing the audio column: `dataset[0]["audio"]` the audio file is automatically decoded and resampled to `dataset.features["audio"].sampling_rate`. Decoding and resampling of a large number of audio files might take a significant amount of time. Thus it is important to first query the sample index before the `"audio"` column, *i.e.* `dataset[0]["audio"]` should **always** be preferred over `dataset["audio"][0]`.

- text: the transcription of the audio file.

- id: unique id of the data sample.

- speaker_id: unique id of the speaker. The same speaker id can be found for multiple data samples.

- chapter_id: id of the audiobook chapter which includes the transcription.
