## Shaded relief image dataset for geomorphological studies of Polish postglacial landscape

This dataset contains a list of 138 png images of shaded relief cut into the 128x128 arrays. The area that the dataset covers is compacted within the
two main geomorphological spheres in Poland - postglacial denuded and nondenuded landscape. Arrays representing one of two categories are labeled accordingly.

Shaded relief scene has been calculated with exposition and sunlight paramiters set to direct south (thus, in this case - 180 degrees).
