# bAbi+ corpus

**bAbi+** is an extension to the [bAbi corpus by Facebook AI](https://research.facebook.com/downloads/babi/) with some incremental phenomena of dialogue (such as self-corrections, pauses, restarts, etc.) added to it. It was first introduced by Shalyminov et al. (2017).

Some of the papers that have used the dataset are:

* *Challenging Neural Dialogue Models with Natural Data: Memory Networks Fail on Incremental Phenomena*. Igor Shalyminov, Arash Eshghi, and Oliver Lemon. 2017.

* *Multi-Task Learning for Domain-General Spoken Disfluency Detection in Dialogue Systems*. Igor Shalyminov, Arash Eshghi, Oliver Lemon. 2018.
