>We introduce DivEMT, the first publicly available post-editing study of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) over a typologically diverse set of target languages. Using a strictly controlled setup, 18 professional translators were instructed to translate or post-edit the same set of English documents into Arabic, Dutch, Italian, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese. During the process, their edits, keystrokes, editing times and pauses were recorded, enabling an in-depth, cross-lingual evaluation of NMT quality and post-editing effectiveness. Using this new dataset, we assess the impact of two state-of-the-art NMT systems, Google Translate and the multilingual mBART-50 model, on translation productivity. We find that post-editing is consistently faster than translation from scratch. However, the magnitude of productivity gains varies widely across systems and languages, highlighting major disparities in post-editing effectiveness for languages at different degrees of typological relatedness to English, even when controlling for system architecture and training data size. We publicly release the complete dataset including all collected behavioral data, to foster new research on the translation capabilities of NMT systems for typologically diverse languages.

### Dataset Summary

This dataset contains the processed `warmup` and `main` splits of the DivEMT dataset. A sample of documents extracted from the Flores-101 corpus were either translated from scratch or post-edited from an existing automatic translation by a total of 18 professional translators across six typologically diverse languages (Arabic, Dutch, Italian, Turkish, Ukrainian, Vietnamese). During the translation, behavioral data (keystrokes, pauses, editing times) were collected using the [PET](https://github.com/wilkeraziz/PET) platform.

We publicly release the processed dataset including all collected behavioural data, to foster new research on the ability of state-of-the-art NMT systems to generate text in typologically diverse languages.

### News ðŸŽ‰

**February, 2023**: The DivEMT dataset now contains linguistic annotations (`*_annotations` fields) computed with Stanza and word-level quality estimation tags (`src_wmt22_qe`, `mt_wmt22_qe`) obtained using the same scripts adopted for the WMT22 QE Task 2.

### Languages

The language data of DivEMT is in English (BCP-47 `en`), Italian (BCP-47 `it`), Dutch (BCP-47 `nl`), Arabic (BCP-47 `ar`), Turkish (BCP-47 `tr`), Ukrainian (BCP-47 `uk`) and Vietnamese (BCP-47 `vi`)

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

The dataset contains two configurations: `main` and `warmup`. `main` contains the full data collected during the main task and analyzed during our experiments. `warmup` contains the data collected in the verification phase, before the main task begins.
