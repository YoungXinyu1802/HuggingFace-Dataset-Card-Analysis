# Dataset Card for Unnatural Instructions (Core data)
This info comes from the **Unnatural Instructions GitHub [repo](https://github.com/orhonovich/unnatural-instructions/)**.

Unnatural Instructions is a dataset of instructions automatically generated by a Large Language model.
See full details in the paper: "[Unnatural Instructions: Tuning Language Models with (Almost) No Human Labor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09689)"

## 🗃️ Content
The Unnatural Instructions core dataset of 68,478 instruction-input-output triplets.

## 📄 Format
### Core data
Each example contains:
- `input`: An input for the task described by the `instruction`
- `instruction_with_input`: The instruction concatenated with the `input`
- `constraints`: The task's output space constraints
- `output`: The output of executing `instruction` with the given `input`
