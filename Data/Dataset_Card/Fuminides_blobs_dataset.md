The blob dataset!

-----

This dataset consists of a collection of 100000 that contains randomly generated blobs over a random noise background. Each image has annotated its number of blobs and if they are large or small.
The task consists of learning at the same time a quantitable guess (number of blobs) and a qualitative one (its size).
