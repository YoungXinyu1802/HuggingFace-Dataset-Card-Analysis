### Dataset Summary
This is the question & answer generation dataset based on the [tweet_qa](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tweet_qa). The test set of the original data is not publicly released, so we randomly sampled test questions from the training set.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards
* `question-answer-generation`: The dataset is assumed to be used to train a model for question & answer generation.
  Success on this task is typically measured by achieving a high BLEU4/METEOR/ROUGE-L/BERTScore/MoverScore (see our paper for more in detail).

### Languages
