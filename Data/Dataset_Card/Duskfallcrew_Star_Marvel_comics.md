Trained with: https://colab.research.google.com/github/Linaqruf/kohya-trainer/blob/main/kohya-LoRA-dreambooth.ipynb

# Where else can i find this ?
Both safetensors files are at: https://civitai.com/models/14831/star-ryan-ripley

# The outputs aren't comic format.
I haven't tested it in WEB UI yet, the scripted outputs largely rely on the actual model. 

# YOU - YOU'RE A DATA SCRAPER!!!
And you're a booger picker! C'mon, work smarter, not harder.  If you REALLY like this content, buy the comics. Seriously, or like find the artist, and buy their merch rather than supporting Disney. 

# You do way too much is there a way to pay you in... anyway?
Yea, XD THROW ME PENNIES IN THE FOUNTAIN OF COFFEE!

# What's the deal, is there a lisc on this?
Creative whatever it is, means that you basically just don't do this to do illegal crap. I'm not responsible for what you generate after you download this. I am not responsible for Disney coming after your ass for making Minnie kiss Deadpool.
