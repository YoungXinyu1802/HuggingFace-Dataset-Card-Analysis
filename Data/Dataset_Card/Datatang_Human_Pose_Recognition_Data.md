### Dataset Summary

10,000 People - Human Pose Recognition Data. This dataset includes indoor and outdoor scenes.This dataset covers males and females. Age distribution ranges from teenager to the elderly, the middle-aged and young people are the majorities. The data diversity includes different shooting heights, different ages, different light conditions, different collecting environment, clothes in different seasons, multiple human poses. For each subject, the labels of gender, race, age, collecting environment and clothes were annotated. The data can be used for human pose recognition and other tasks.
