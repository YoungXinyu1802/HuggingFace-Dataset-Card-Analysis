# Aggregated Captcha Images and Text

## Credits

All the images (not the texts) here contained have been downloaded and selected from various datasets on kaggle.com

### What is this?

This is a dataset containing some hundreds of thousands of images taken from real and used captchas (reCaptcha, hCaptcha and various others) and containing an equally big amount of random 4-8 length texts generated each one in 363 different fonts and with different random noise, size, colors and scratches on them.

While the texts part might result difficult to recognize from the models you could train, the images quantity allows the model to offer a significant possibility of recognization of captcha images.

### Disclaimer

This dataset is NOT intended to break any ToS of any website or to execute malicious, illegal or unethical actions. This dataset is distributed with a purely informative and educative finality, namely the study of the weakness or strength of the current protection systems.
You will for example notice how puzzle based captchas are highly resistant to this kind of analysis.
