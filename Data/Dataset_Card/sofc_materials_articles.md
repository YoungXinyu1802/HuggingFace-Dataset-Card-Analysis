### Dataset Summary

> The SOFC-Exp corpus contains 45 scientific publications about solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), published between 2013 and 2019 as open-access articles all with a CC-BY license. The dataset was manually annotated by domain experts with the following information:
> 
> * Mentions of relevant experiments have been marked using a graph structure corresponding to instances of an Experiment frame (similar to the ones used in FrameNet.) We assume that an Experiment frame is introduced to the discourse by mentions of words such as report, test or measure (also called the frame-evoking elements). The nodes corresponding to the respective tokens are the heads of the graphs representing the Experiment frame.
> * The Experiment frame related to SOFC-Experiments defines a set of 16 possible participant slots. Participants are annotated as dependents of links between the frame-evoking element and the participant node.
> * In addition, we provide coarse-grained entity/concept types for all frame participants, i.e, MATERIAL, VALUE or DEVICE. Note that this annotation has not been performed on the full texts but only on sentences containing information about relevant experiments, and a few sentences in addition. In the paper, we run experiments for both tasks only on the set of sentences marked as experiment-describing in the gold standard, which is admittedly a slightly simplified setting. Entity types are only partially annotated on other sentences. Slot filling could of course also be evaluated in a fully automatic setting with automatic experiment sentence detection as a first step.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

- `topic-classification`: The dataset can be used to train a model for topic-classification, to identify sentences that mention SOFC-related experiments. 
- `named-entity-recognition`: The dataset can be used to train a named entity recognition model to detect `MATERIAL`, `VALUE`, `DEVICE`, and `EXPERIMENT` entities. 
- `slot-filling`: The slot-filling task is approached as fine-grained entity-typing-in-context, assuming that each sentence represents a single experiment frame. Sequence tagging architectures are utilized for tagging the tokens of each experiment-describing sentence with the set of slot types.


The paper experiments with BiLSTM architectures with `BERT`- and `SciBERT`- generated token embeddings, as well as with `BERT` and `SciBERT` directly for the modeling task. A simple CRF architecture is used as a baseline for sequence-tagging tasks. Implementations of the transformer-based architectures can be found in the `huggingface/transformers` library: [BERT](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased), [SciBERT](https://huggingface.co/allenai/scibert_scivocab_uncased)

### Data Splits

This dataset consists of three splits:

|                            | Train  | Valid | Test |
| -----                      | ------ | ----- | ---- |
| Input Examples             |  26    |   8   |  11  |


The authors propose the experimental setting of using the training data in a 5-fold cross validation setting for development and tuning, and finally applying tte model(s) to the independent test set.
