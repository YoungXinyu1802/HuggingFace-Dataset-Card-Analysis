EN-ME Special Chars is a dataset of roughly 58000 aligned sentence pairs in English and Middle English, collected from the works of Geoffrey Chaucer, John Lydgate, John Wycliffe, and the Gawain Poet.

It includes special characters such as Ã¾. 

There is mild standardization, but this dataset reflects the spelling inconsistencies characteristic of Middle English.
